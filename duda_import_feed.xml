<title>Happy New Year</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/happy-new-year.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> Happy New Year to you all!

We are so excited for what 2025 has in store. A new year means fresh beginnings, and we have something special coming your way. Stay tuned for our new brand, an inspired website, exciting online offerings, and a whole new look for our retreat experiences. It's going to be an amazing year of transformation!


But for now, I just want to wish you all a marvellous 2025. May it bring you joy, peace, fun, and adventure.

Personally, I’m glad to see the new year. Last year was tough in many ways, but the more I talk to friends, colleagues, family, and even strangers, the more I realise that no one has it all good. If they say they do, they’re probably lying. There’s always at least one part of life that could use a little tweaking—a challenge in finances, relationships, health, work, family, or friendships. No one is exempt from struggles, because life isn’t meant to be perfect. It’s an ebb and flow, just like the seasons. There’s no perpetual summer.

And that’s part of what makes life so beautiful—the challenges help us grow. They push us to evolve, and that’s why we’re here.

I sometimes think of life as being divided into thirds. One third of the time, things are going great. You’re high as a kite, loving life, everything is falling into place—maybe a new job, a great relationship, or just feeling on top of the world. The second third might feel a bit blah. You’re in a bit of a rut—fitness is stale, work feels uninspiring, or you just can’t find your spark. The final third tends to bring some drama or a challenge—there’s a problem that needs solving, something to let go of, or some deep struggle to face.

But here’s the key: life is never all bad. Just like the sun follows the rain, joy always follows pain. So as we step into 2025, let’s remember that we are all in this together. Stop comparing yourself to others, and take comfort in the fact that no one, as far as I know, has figured out how to escape the lows of life.
So, do you. Stay in your lane. Stay focused. Stay peaceful. Stay vibrant. And trust that all shall be well.

Happy New Year to you all!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/recipe-nettle-oat-wraps.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> In late January and early February the young nettle leaves are starting to appear. Nettles are full of vitamins and minerals especially rich in iron and vitamins A and D. They can be cooked in soups as a substitute for spinach, or use raw blitzed for pesto. These nettle oat wraps/crepes are versatile and can be filled with savoury or sweet ingredients. They have a mild, earthy flavour from the nettles, which pairs well with a variety of fillings!


<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

-  100 g rolled oats (use gluten-free if necessary)
-  250 ml plant-based milk (such as oat or almond milk) 
-  20 g fresh nettle leaves, blanched and finely chopped (or 10 g dried nettles, soaked in hot water for 5 minutes, then drained) 
-  1 tbsp flaxseed meal mixed with 3 tbsp water (flax “egg”)
-  1/2 tsp salt
-  1 tbsp olive oil (plus more for cooking)  

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

 1.	Prepare Flax Egg: Mix the flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp water in a small bowl and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens.

 2.	Blend Ingredients: In a blender, combine the rolled oats, plant-based milk, blanched nettle leaves (or soaked dried nettles), flax “egg,” salt, and olive oil. Blend until smooth and let the batter rest for 10 minutes to thicken slightly. 

 3.	Cook Wraps/Crepes: Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and add a little olive oil. Pour a small amount of the batter (about 1/4 cup or 60 ml) onto the pan and spread it out thinly with a spatula or by tilting the pan. 

 4.	Cook Until Set: Cook each wrap for 2-3 minutes on one side, until bubbles form and the edges start to lift. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side.

 5.	Repeat: Continue with the remaining batter, adding a little more oil to the pan as needed.

<title>6 great skincare tips</title>

<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/30ml-Balaclava-768x768.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> Here at Zest Life we are all about wellness and vitality and as work our way through Winter it can be hard to feel such vitality. This is where we choose to turn the self care that we can implement on a daily basis without too much effort - Skin. As we all know when you look good, you feel good!

<strong>Follow Laura's top 6 key skincare tips</strong> to see you breeze through the colder Christmas period:



<h3>1. <strong>Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Why:</strong> Winter air can quickly dry out your skin, so staying hydrated from the inside is crucial. 
</li>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the day and having a reusable water bottle on the kitchen counter top will remind you to hydrate. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Use a Rich Moisturizer</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Why:</strong> Cold temperatures and indoor heating can strip your skin of its natural moisture.
</li>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> Switch to a thicker, more nourishing moisturizer with ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, or ceramides to keep your skin soft and supple. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Exfoliate Gently</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Why:</strong> Winter can leave your skin looking dull and flaky, so gentle exfoliation can help refresh your complexion.
</li>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> Use a mild exfoliant with AHAs (like lactic acid) or an enzyme-based exfoliant once or twice a week, avoiding harsh scrubs. Bathing Beauty have a foot scrub called <a href="https://bathing-beauty.co.uk/shop/new/sock-foot-scrub/">Sock Scrub</a> - a winter doesn't go by without us using this.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Protect Your Skin from the Cold</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Why:</strong> Wind and low temperatures can damage your skin and cause redness or irritation.
</li>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> Apply a barrier cream or balm before heading outdoors to protect your skin from harsh weather. We love Bathing Beauty <a href="https://bathing-beauty.co.uk/shop/face/balaclava-the-no-eau-protective-face-salve/">Balaclava Face Salve</a> - it's so rich and the citrus scent smells amazing on your skin.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Treat Your Hands and Lips</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Why:</strong> Hands and lips are more prone to chapping in winter.
</li>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> Keep a rich hand cream and nourishing lip balm handy to prevent dryness and cracking. <a href="https://bathing-beauty.co.uk/shop/face/cocoa-lipslick/">Cocoa Lipslick</a> from Bathing Beauty is the perfect pocket sized product.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Don't Skip Sunscreen</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>Why:</strong> Sun exposure can damage your skin even in winter.
</li>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) daily, especially if you're spending time outside or around reflective surfaces like snow.
</li>
</ul>

<title>6 top benefits of using a sauna</title>
<link>https://keepmesnug.co.uk/6-top-benefits-of-using-a-sauna/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://keepmesnug.co.uk/6-top-benefits-of-using-a-sauna/</guid>
<pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:46:33 +0000</pubDate>
<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pexels-pavel-danilyuk-6667412-crop-768x768.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> At Zest Life we love to sauna and to mix that up with a cold water dip is even better. We all know saunas are not only relaxing but also offer a range of health benefits. Incorporating sauna sessions into your wellness routine can help support physical and mental well-being in many ways. Just remember to stay hydrated and listen to your body while using the sauna!

Here are Laura's <strong>6 top benefits</strong> of using a sauna:




<h3>1. <strong>Improved Circulation</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> The heat in a sauna causes your blood vessels to dilate, which improves blood flow and increases circulation.

</li>
 	<li>
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Better circulation can lead to improved oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscles and organs, helping with recovery, reducing muscle soreness, and promoting overall heart health.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Detoxification</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> The high heat induces sweating, which helps flush toxins and impurities from the body through your skin.

</li>
 	<li>
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Sweating can help eliminate heavy metals, chemicals, and other toxins, potentially leading to clearer skin and improved overall health.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Stress Relief</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> The warmth of a sauna helps your muscles relax, promotes endorphin release, and encourages a meditative, calm state.

</li>
 	<li>
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Regular sauna sessions can reduce stress, promote mental relaxation, and help with managing anxiety and tension.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Improved Skin Health</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> The sweating process helps clear pores, removes dead skin cells, and promotes better skin hydration.

</li>
 	<li>
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Using a sauna regularly can result in smoother, clearer skin and can help with conditions like acne, eczema, and psoriasis.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Pain Relief and Muscle Relaxation</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> The heat of the sauna can relax sore or stiff muscles, ease joint pain, and increase flexibility.

</li>
 	<li>
<strong>Benefit:</strong> Saunas are commonly used by athletes and people with chronic pain for recovery, as they can reduce muscle tension and inflammation.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. <strong>Boosted Immune Function</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>
<strong>How:</strong> The heat in a sauna raises your body temperature, which mimics a fever and can stimulate the immune system.

</li>
 	<li>
<strong>Benefit:</strong> This "artificial fever" can help enhance the body's ability to fight off infections and reduce the frequency of colds or other illnesses.

</li>
</ul>
The power of sauna has been known for centuries and for that reason we are excited to bring a sauna session to all of our Anglesey swim retreats in 2025. We are teaming up with a fabulous local company called Sawna Bach who have sauna pods at both beach and lake locations here in North Wales. 

Day 1 of your swim retreat will be a swim and sauna experience at Llyn Padarn, one of the most majestic lakes at the foot of snowdon. You will be expertly guided in the water and the private sauna will be right there for you to relax in post or in between swims.

<title>Tofu Chocolate Mousse with Cranberry Layer</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true">https://keepmesnug.co.uk/tofu-chocolate-mousse-with-cranberry-layer/</guid>

<category><![CDATA[Recipes]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/recipe-chocolate-mousse-with-cranberry.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> For December Aimee has shared her vegan chocolate mousse made from silken tofu. It has a rich, chocolatey texture with a tart hint from the cranberries, making it a delicious festive dessert option!  The cranberry layer will add a beautiful contrast to the rich chocolate mousse, both visually and in flavour. Aimee says “In the photo I’ve put the tart cranberry layer on the bottom, and arranged the soaked dried cranberries on top, rather than folding them through the mousse.”


<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

-  300 g silken tofu, drained
-  150 g dark chocolate (dairy-free, 70% cocoa or higher), melted 
-  2 tbsp maple syrup or agave syrup (about 30 g) 
-  1 tsp vanilla extract (about 5 g)
-  50 g dried cranberries, chopped
-  2 tbsp orange juice (about 30 g), for soaking the cranberries
-  Optional: 1/4 tsp sea salt (for added flavor) 

Cranberry Layer 

-  150 g fresh or frozen cranberries 
-  2-3 tbsp maple syrup or agave syrup (about 30-45 g, adjust to taste)
-  60 ml water 
-  1 tsp lemon juice (about 5 g)
-  1/2 tsp cornstarch or arrowroot powder mixed with 1 tbsp water (to thicken)

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

 1.	Soak the Cranberries: Place the chopped dried cranberries in a bowl with the orange juice. Let them soak for about 10-15 minutes to soften. 
 2.	Blend the Tofu: In a food processor or blender, blend the silken tofu until smooth and creamy.
 3.	Add Chocolate and Flavorings: Add the melted dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and sea salt (if using) to the tofu. Blend until well combined and smooth.
 4.	Stir in Cranberries: Drain any excess orange juice from the soaked cranberries and gently fold them into the mousse mixture.
 5.	Chill: Transfer the mousse into serving cups or bowls and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours to set.

Cranberry layer 

1. Cook the Cranberries: In a small saucepan, combine the cranberries, maple syrup, and water. Cook over medium heat until the cranberries start to burst and soften, about 5-7 minutes. 
2. Add Lemon Juice and Thicken: Stir in the lemon juice. If you prefer a thicker consistency, add the cornstarch mixture and cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens. 
3. Blend for a Smooth Layer (Optional): For a smooth layer, blend the cranberry mixture in a blender or with an immersion blender until smooth.
4. Cool: Allow the cranberry mixture to cool to room temperature. 
5. Add to Mousse: Spoon the cranberry layer over the set chocolate mousse and spread evenly.
6. Chill Again: Return the mousse with the cranberry layer to the refrigerator and chill for an additional 30 minutes to set the top layer.
7. Serve: Garnish a dusting of cocoa powder.

November brings cooler temperatures and wet and windy spells. Warm up with some delicious wholesome soup like this white bean and seaweed broth from Aimee our retreat chef: "This nourishing broth combines the creaminess of white beans with the umami flavor of seaweed and the nutrients from green juice powder. It’s perfect as a light meal or starter!"


<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

-  2 tbsp olive oil 
-  1 medium onion, finely chopped
-  2 cloves garlic, minced 
-  2 medium carrots, chopped (about 150 g) 
-  1 celery stalk, chopped (about 80 g) 
-  1.5 liters vegetable broth 
-  400 g cooked white beans (such as cannellini or navy beans), drained and rinsed 
-  5 g dried seaweed (e.g., wakame or dulse), soaked in water for 10 minutes, then chopped 
 -  1 tbsp superfood wales green powder (about 10 g) 
-  1 tsp tamari or gluten-free soy sauce 
(optional, for extra umami, add 1 tsp yeast extract 5 g)
-  Salt and black pepper to taste 
-  1 tbsp lemon juice (about 15 g)
-  Fresh parsley or chives for garnish (optional)  

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

 1.	Sauté Vegetables: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are softened.

 2.	Add Broth and Beans: Pour in the vegetable broth and add the cooked white beans. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes. 

 3.	Add Seaweed and Green Juice Powder: Stir in the soaked seaweed and green juice powder. Simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes. 

 4.	Season: Add the tamari, if using, along with salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.

 5.	Serve: Ladle the broth into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley or chives if desired.

<pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2024 08:00:04 +0000</pubDate>
<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ZestLife_June24_STILLS_a7iv-EM409789-WEB-RES-blog.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" /> In my twenties I was bulimic, depressed, overweight, drank too much and had no way to regulate my emotions healthily. I was working long hours on charter superyachts, partying far too hard and my time was not my own. I was a functioning, unwell woman. Since those dark depths, I have prioritised time and money on my health and wellness above all else, even before my children. I know that if I am not well, how can I possibly look after them? I invest in myself now so that I can then be a better person to everyone in my life. 

Health and wellness doesn't come easily. You have to really work hard at it and be in it for the long game. This wellness journey is for life, not just for a month or two and sorry to say, there is no quick fix either. 

You might say I am selfish with my time but when you have been really ill, there rises up a driving force that makes you fiercely protect the things that make you feel even slightly better in life. I want to feel well, energised and vital well into old age.

For me now, I train outside where possible and I also see a group PT for weight sessions twice a week. It's brilliant as I don't think, I just turn up and do. As well as this commitment I am a member of a small leisure club. It's not particularly fancy but it has a pool, sauna, steam room and hot tub. I go there 2/3 times a week and in the winter it is a lovely treat to visit after a long cold run and warm my bones in the sauna. There is monthly investment of course but it is something I look forward and I see the rest time as a key part of my health and wellness. The accountability of PT guidance helps to keep up the fitness habit and the luxury in the form of the club is like a reward, which keeps me running and wild swimming in the colder months.

Now you make think that these are excessive and unnecessary expenses. I know we can all work out at home and go to the local council pool. But don't you think that sometimes it's just great to have a break from the incessant motherload thinking and simply be told what to do? I know I do, and that in itself is part of my health journey. Thankfully I no longer feel guilty about taking this time out anymore.

So back to my gym and I was in the changing room the other mid morning, surrounded by mostly retired ladies and I overheard a conversation along these lines.

Lady 1: Have you been coming here long?
Lady 2: No, I have recently retired so joined last month.
Lady 1: That's nice, it's lovely isn't it. I have been coming for a while since I retired too.
Lady 2: Yes I do enjoy the swim now I have time. It's a great way to start my day. But I do feel guilty for taking the time out.
Lady 1: You shouldn't feel guilty, you deserve it. You've earnt this.
Lady 2: Yes you are right I do. I have worked so hard all my life and now I am going to start enjoying myself.

I listened in and felt such sadness as these elderly ladies have waited all this time till they retired to finally put themselves first. I wondered how much have they sacrificed for others or how much of their own emotions have they suppressed to keep the peace. I know I am projecting and I am sure they have had lovely lives but it makes me question...

As a society why do we wait till retirement to rest and enjoy ourselves?

Is there a reason we (especially women) feel guilty for taking time and money to invest in ourselves?

Do we see it as too much rest time and not productive enough?

Is it a low self worth?

Who knows, it will be different for everyone but I say there is no time like the present to start investing in your wellness journey and I will continue to take rest, dip, sauna and steam as quite frankly I'll take anything that helps me to slow the f**k down, I hope you do to.

<title>Pumpkin Power</title>

<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/99191a82-f231-476a-8509-7daffe80b683-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /> Pumpkins are a superfood. They help you see in the dark, fight cancer and boost your immune systems. Pumpkins also taste lovely, roasted in soups or a side, so don't just use them for creating laterns, make sure you get creative in the kitchen too. Check out the recipes at the bottom of this post.



1. Pumpkins can improve your vision.

They are rich in beta carotene, an antioxidant that your body turns into vitamin A. Vitamin A helps sharpen your vision, allowing you to see more clearly in low light. It also helps support the health of your retina and cornea. Pumpkins are also high in vitamin C, which reduces your risk of developing macular degeneration and cataracts.
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;">2. They lower your cancer risk</p>
“<em>Pumpkins are packed with nutrients and antioxidants, making them a cancer-fighting food</em>” says Joshua George R.D. Clinical Nutrition and Patient Services manager at Inspira Health. “<em>Because they’re rich in vitamin A, pumpkins also lower your risk for certain types of cancer, including prostate and lung cancer.</em>” Additionally, pumpkins contain carotenoids, a pigment that functions as an antioxidant. Carotenoids may lower your risk of developing throat, pancreatic, stomach and breast cancer.

3. They can give you an immunity boost

<img class="alignright wp-image-6840 border" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9fa810e8-68db-4f0e-b438-e1f99ec9e472-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />

Incorporating pumpkin into your diet can help your immune system become more effective at fighting off germs. Pumpkins contain vitamins C and E, beta carotene, folate and iron, which all help strengthen your immune system.

The best way to reap the health benefits from this seasonal superfood is by avoiding high levels of sugar and artificial flavoring found in pumpkin-flavored treats. Instead, roast your pumpkin to make a savory soup, snack or side dish.

We have found that recipes that ask for squash work really well with pumpkin.

Warm up with Kelly’s rich and aromatic lemony spicey dahl, a comforting dish full of bold flavors and vibrant spices. Begin by frying onion, garlic, and fresh ginger in fragrant coconut oil, then add whole mustard and cumin seeds for depth, also ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala and juice of a lemon - Kelly suggests throwing in the whole lemon in for an extra zesty kick. Slow-cooked until smooth and creamy, this dahl offers a perfect balance of savory and tangy notes. For those who like a bit of heat, toss in fresh green chilies for a spicy finish.


<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

1 white onion - medium  
1 large knob ginger
5 cloves garlic
1 tbsp coconut oil

Spices
2 tsp Mustard seeds 
2 tsp Cumin seeds 
1 tbsp Cumin powder

1 tbsp Turmeric 
1 tsp Gram masala 
1 tsp Coriander powder 
1 tbsp Vegetable stock powder 

2 cups red lentils 
Boiling water to cover
1 lemon
Salt
Fresh green chillis (optional)



&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

Chop onion, julienne ginger into thin strips, mince or slice garlic as preferred. 

Fry off onion, garlic and ginger for a few minutes in the coconut oil. 

Add whole spices - mustard seeds and cumin seeds and fry for a further few minutes. 

Then add ground spices and stock powder. Stir dry fry for a moment then add a little boiling water to make a paste. 

Cook for a few minutes 

Now add the red lentils and cover with boiling water. Stir and cover the pan. 

Leave for 20 mins on medium heat. Add more water if needed.

Add juice of a lemon, also throw in the whole squeezed lemon. 

Cook on low heat until desired consistency.

<title>Lessons from a sea swim – goal seting and motivation</title>

<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/lessons-from-a-sea-swim-819x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="375" /> Towards the end of September I have been able to really put in some great miles in the water. Being by the sea and having the time to swim has been glorious and I have loved every minute of swimming outside. For me swimming is pure meditation. As the season starts to shift to Autumn and the water temperature begins to drop it becomes harder and harder to keep that habit going. The impermanence of great swim conditions is part of the beauty of open water swimming and I always have a strong pull to keep that September swimming feeling going, even though I know it can't last. The water temperature gets too cold and the choice is to either squeeze into a wetsuit or you stay in your skin and don't stay in as long. I will always choose the latter.

Having said that, this last weekend I was determined to do three last long swims, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve. There was a feeling of this being my last opportunity to swim those distances this year and I didn't want to waste them. Being child free and staying by the sea for the weekend there was nothing to stop me. I checked the tide times and knew it would be an early rise each day to catch the high tide. Day 1, great swim, warm water, feeling good. Day 2 however was a different story. 7am I arrive at the beach and the wind is on shore causing the sea to be very choppy. Getting in was tough and every stroke I felt like I wanted to just turn into shore and run back but then I kept thinking of the end of the day and how disappointed I would feel if I gave up halfway. Mathew was with me too and the thought of him finishing and me not was certainly a situation I did not want to be in! So, on I swam and the mile was done. Pretty shattered and almost feeling sea sick from the choppy sea, but completed none the less. Then Day 3, I awoke having had a terrible night's sleep, I was exhausted. I was hopeful the sea would have calmed down overnight but it was still frisky and the thought of another rough swim was really tough. I really did not want to swim. It was overcast and a little cooler too. It took every bit of will power and thoughts of gratitude at being able to swim to get me in the water. I squeezed on my hat and goggles and before I had a chance to talk myself out of it I was in. Instead of fighting the rolling waves this time I tried to roll with them. It almost became quite fun as I frollicked about, bashing my way through the waves. At one point I even caught myself smiling under the water at the sheer joy of in that moment being so animal like rather than human. Then it was over and the feeling of completing all three swims was fantastic. Yes, it was hard but being back on land wrapped in a warm towel and drinking a hot drink made it all so sweet.

It got me thinking about goal setting in general and how easy it would have been not to do those swims. I could have just showed up to the weekend with thoughts along the lines of "I think I'll have a dip if the weather is good". If that was the case I probably wouldn't even gone half as far or maybe not even swam at all on the last day and all of that too would have been fine. But when you do have a vision it really does help with achieving your goals, compared to having no vision at all and simply hoping for the best.

The mental strength I learn through my exercise, I then take into my everyday life. I start thinking about a clear vision for my professional and personal life and what those goals look like. These thoughts are not rocket science but I do think we sometimes need a gentle reminder about having a goal setting mentality so that life doesn't race by in a blur of if only........ Remembering that not every day is going to be a perfect day for you to achieve your goal. There will be many days where achieving your goal takes some grit and determination as you battle the elements and the mental chatter that tries to sway you otherwise but I believe that it is in those moments where the greatness lies and your true self shines through.

Lessons in Goal Setting + Motivation

1. Have a clear vision of what you want to achieve. See it in your head and if you are not visual then write that vision down.

2. Set goals that are realistic to you and your ability. Get to know yourself, because it's a fine line between overstretching yourself and not doing enough.

3. Show up even on the rubbish days. You can't just turn to life on the bright, sparkly days. You show up to them all.

4. Don't wait for the perfect conditions to start achieving your goals, start today.

5. The hardest part of any exercise regime is simply getting out the door. So get your kit ready the night before, have everything in order so you can easily follow through with your plan.

6. Don't take anything for granted - swim/run/race/flow/ be in this day as if it is your last.

<title>Granola Stuffed Apples</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/granola-stuffed-apples1-sq.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> With the comforting flavours of autumn this is a simple yet delicious dessert that combines the natural sweetness of apples with a warm, spiced granola filling. Aimee uses Pink Lady apples - but any juicy sweet eater will work well. Her granola is a blend of oats, pecans, coconut sugar, and cinnamon which adds a crunchy texture and a nutty richness, perfectly complementing the tender baked apples. Serve warm, paired with a dollop of creamy yogurt for a dessert that’s as nutritious as it is delicious. Ideal for warming up after a swim session this dish is sure to become a retreat favourite.


<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

- 4 apples, something similar to a Pink Lady. 
- 50g coconut sugar
- 25g oats 
- 15g oat flour 
- 15g pecans 
- pinch of cinnamon 
- pinch of salt 
- 50g soft butter 



&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

1. Preheat the oven to 180C. 

2. cut off the top of the apple. Ideally, it's about 2cm, cut in a straight line that includes the stem. Repeat with the other apples. 

3. To core out the apple (if you don't have an apple corer), use a spoon and at a slight angle work to hollow out the center of the apple. You want to aim to leave a good width so the apple doesn't go floppy when cooked. 

4. To stuff the apple, you can either use a granola you already have, or make granola. To make a granola mix inside the apple, combine oat flour, oats, pecans, cinnamon, salt and coconut sugar. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the mixture. 

5. Stuff the granola into the apple, and place the apple top back onto the apple. 

6. Bake for 30 minutes. And let cool slightly. 

7. Serve with yogurt and a pinch more cinnamon.

<title>6 Step Great Morning Routine</title>
<link>https://keepmesnug.co.uk/6-step-great-morning-routine/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://keepmesnug.co.uk/6-step-great-morning-routine/</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 11:12:03 +0000</pubDate>
<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pexels-edwardeyer-2228889.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> I have spent the past twenty years chasing health. Health comes in many forms; mental, physical, emotional, spiritual and your health is tested at every different stage of life. There was a period when I had to lean heavily into physical healing after my broken back and that in turn led to a spiritual healing path. After a relationship break up, even though it was hard, I knew I had to focus on my emotional healing in order to move on. Worrying set backs in work have encouraged me to focus on my mental resilience and post giving birth has been an explosive dive into healing all of the above. 
I know that life is not easy. Life is forever throwing curveballs and sending challenges that are sent to try us. That in itself makes me wonder whether optimum health can ever be reached, who knows.

One thing I do know that helps me to cope with the trials of life is my morning routine and wherever I am in the world I make one. My mornings are varied because I lead two lives; children with me and children not with me. So children with me mornings as you can imagine are busy, loud, often rushed and chaotic and on the flip side child free mornings are quiet, time rich, easy and bliss filled. Throughout the summer I stay in different homes or retreat venues and I can find this very unsettling too. Regardless of where I am or whom I’m with, I believe that how I start my day sets the president for the rest of the day.

On that note, what ever troubles you are going through, setting a morning routine can be key to your health and I believe it will help frame your day in a healthy, more positive way. Here are my top 7 steps to a Great Morning Routine (and they don’t involve an Instagramable green matcha latte!)

1. Set a daily alarm

We all know about cycadian rhythms, I don't need to go on about them here but us humans we thrive off routine. Pick a time that works for you and rise, consistently at that time. In the week I have an alarm that is the same every day and it’s 6am. Weekends are more relaxed but the children are my alarm then. If you have children I advise you to make sure your rising time is half an hour before any of your children generally wake. I feel for you if you have early risers!

2. Enjoy a hot drink

Those of you who enjoy hot drinks, make time each morning to enjoy a soothing, hot drink and take the time to make it well. I start with hot water and ginger and then a proper coffee. It’s never straight to coffee but that ginger water can get chugged pretty quickly if it's been a rough night with children and the coffee is calling. I like to peel the ginger, cut it in slices then place in a lovely mug before pouring over the boiled water. Invest in a coupe of beautiful mugs that make you smile, as a gorgeous mug is key to this part of the morning. When ever I visit places I always hunt out ceramics shops and buy handmade mugs, I now have quite a collection!

3. Ring fence some time for peace.

So after having made my warming drink, I sit and enjoy it in peace, doing absolutely nothing. No phone, no computer, no noise, it's just me and my drink and I try to make this as mindful as possible. I generally sit on my mat in the hope that I might get time to do some yoga but even if I don't get to move and stretch I still feel as if I have opened up my spiritual home and my mind feels calmer for doing so. Some days this time is the only connection I have with the mat. I have learnt that this is ok and that tomorrow may gift more time to the self practise of yoga.

4. Find something to admire in nature

I live in an urban setting but looking out of my kitchen window I can see beyond the rooftops to a small mountain. Every morning I sit and stare at that said mountain. This is part of my silent, mindful practise. I take this moment to appreciate nature. If I had a lawn I'd probably go walking barefoot in the grass but I don't, so I make do. When I am at Mathews he too lives in an urban setting but he has a beautiful Eucalyptus tree outside his front door, so that is my focus of attention. I sit on his front door step and stare. I watch its movement, admire the leaves soft hues and listen to their almost silent rustling.

5. Make a to do list with one thing

I don’t know about you but I have always got a master list going on, categorsised - work, kids, home, fun, shop, trips, order, call, fix etc etc you know how it is. This list never gets any smaller! I have accepted this too. In the hope that I don't feel too overwhelmed I write down one thing to do/achieve each day. I write this on a post it note and stick it on top of the master list. I developed this thought process after I had Freddie my eldest. I just couldn’t believe how little time I had to accomplish anything. It was quite soul destroying to feel like nothing was being done. Yes I was feeding and looking after a baby which is a miracle in itself but that didn’t give the same kick as actually achieving something in the day. I started with just aiming for one thing; making that one call, or writing that one email, or sewing that one button back on… and it helped. Stuff now gets done, it may not be much but it gets done. My theory is slow and steady wins the race.

6. Exercise

Days when I have the children are more time precious and waiting till they get to school before I exercise can be an ask, but then I have the days when I wake up child free I can be out the house at the crack of dawn. Either way, every morning I move my body. I love to get my heart rate up with a run or a swim, but if the energy levels aren’t there it’s a walk and some yoga. It’s never too late to begin an exercise routine and for it to become a habit. Try to find out what brings you the most joy and do more of that.

I hope these tips help you to have a great morning, I really do. You might already have your own glorious morning ritual, or have begun to dabble in a few of the above, either way the start of your day acts like your beginning book end so make it as nourishing as you can. It’s a gift to wake up to a new day, don’t waste it scrolling through Instagram. And if incorporating habits like this seem hard I invite you to <a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/best-yoga-retreats-uk/">join us on a retreat</a> where these steps are laid out for you and all you have to do is show up and enjoy.

2 tsp dandelion or chicory coffee 
 (coffee works well here too, as does decaf and cold brew)
120 grams almond milk
30 grams vanilla protein powder
10 grams almond butter

to make it sweeter: 1-2 drops of liquid stevia or maple 



&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

1. Brew up the chicory or dandelion coffee, mixing well. Or brew regular coffee as usual. 

2. Leave on the side while you add everything else to a hi-speed blender. 

3. While your smoothie is blending, slowly pour in the coffee. 

4. Serve over ice.

<title>A Family Glamping Retreat Adventure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/family-glamping-retreat01.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> The summer holidays are in full swing. If you don't have children or your children have grown up, the summer holidays might be a time to relax and have fun, but as a parent of three young children, it's a period of time where anything other than looking after your children has to fall by the wayside and your every focus is on entertaining them. For the children it's idyllic, 6 weeks of no school, but for the parents it's another endurance event. It can honestly start to feel like quite a strain.

So, that being said, this year I planned ahead and booked lots of exciting things for the children and a family nature retreat was one of them. I am not a camper and never will be, but when someone offers a glamping bell tent in exchange for teaching morning yoga, I thought it rude not to take such an opportunity. I normally wouldn't have the confidence to teach in an unknown space, at an unknown location, but after hosting a great week's retreat in the Lakes earlier this year, I had a wave of positivity which inspired me to accepting this gig. How glad I am that I did.

<img class="border  alignright wp-image-6661" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/family-glamping-retreat02.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" />

Every morning began rather creakily as I woke from my futon, but sitting on the deck in peace overlooking the hills of North Wales with coffee in hand (for five minutes) made it all worthwhile. There were only a few tents so it was a wonderfully intimate retreat in a stunning rural location. In the centre of the field they had a covered open-air deck and it was such a joy to teach outside with the sun beaming in from all angles. A few hearty campers joined each morning and by the third morning we had a full house complete with children.

One of the joys of this retreat was that it was fully catered. I honestly think that was what swung it for me, three meals a day that I didn't have to shop, plan or cook for. That in itself is a retreat. It was homemade, tasty and wholesome; one night was wood-fired pizza which was incredible, so we felt very nourished. Workshops were included every day from bush-craft to beekeeping, to foraging and veg growing, that the whole family got involved in. The absolute highlight though was an adults-only wild swimming pond and sauna that was fired up each evening. It was the perfect way to wind down after a long, full-on day of parenting.

The children had such fun running around late into the evening, as us parents chatted around the campfire. It felt such a gift to be able to give them this freedom and opportunity to make new friends. They never wanted to come in to sleep which meant no evening downtime for me, but nevertheless it was worth it as no one ever goes camping to catch up on sleep. That being said, it was a very nurturing environment and I would love to go again.

It made me think a retreat is not always time away from family, and that maybe a family retreat from Zest Life might be on the cards, who knows. But for now I'll continue to work with adults, at least they go to bed when they're told!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/recipe-quiche2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> Discover our new favorite, topped with vegan cheese, this gluten-free vegan quiche is delicious, wholesome and satisfyingly hearty. The crust, made from a nutritious blend of rice flour, buckwheat flour, and gram flour, is bound with flax seed 'egg', creating a crisp and golden base. The creamy silken tofu filling and mix of vegetables – we've included onions, squash, green beans and mixed herbs – can be customized with whatever you have on hand. Served warm for brunch or cold as a light dinner, it’s a delightful and versatile dish.


<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

Base:

480 grams glutinous rice flour
180 grams buckwheat flour
180 grams gram flour
25 grams xanthan gum
4.5 grams salt
170 grams butter 
20 grams ground flaxseed soaked in 120 grams water for at least 10 minutes
210 grams ice cold water

Filling (egg): 

425g silken tofu 
270g plant-based milk
40g nutritional yeast
3 cloves garlic
5g black salt
10g turmeric
5g paprika
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp olive oil 
45 grams chickpea flour

Filling (vegetable options): 

Use up whatever you have around, such as: 
1 red onion 
half summer squash 
200g beans - fava, green beans etc 
cherry tomatoes 
plenty of mixed herbs 
1/2 block smoked applewood vegan cheese 

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

1. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl (rice flour, chickpea, buckwheat) and mix in the butter

2. Add the soaked flaxseed "egg" and cold water until it forms a dough. Chill in the fridge for a minimum of 20 minutes

3. While the dough is chilling, prepare the filling. Add all the "egg" ingredients together in a hi-speed blender until smooth. You're looking for a texture without grittiness.

4. Choose your vegetable filling. If using squash, cut thin slices or cube and roast after tossing in oil, salt and pepper. Any other vegetables can be cut as you choose

5. Roll out the dough on a sheet of parchment paper, you're aiming for a thickness of 1cm.

6. Butter and flour your chosen quiche tin. Flip the pastry onto the quiche tin, tuck it into place. Use a fork to make a few rows of holes in the pie crust.

7. Pour in some of the tofu egg filling and arrange your vegetables, topping with more tofu egg, and finally, cheese it up!

8. Bake in.a preheated oven of 180C for 40 minutes. Check with a toothpick in the centre to see if its done. It shouldn't jiggle too much in the middle.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/recipe-granola-and-courgette.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> This refreshing and flavorful dish has a balance of tangy, creamy, and crunchy elements. Tender courgette slices are marinated in a zesty garlic vinaigrette, infused with fresh mint for a burst of herbal freshness. Paired with a creamy homemade vegan tofu ricotta and topped with a crunchy, savoury granola, this dish offers a delightful harmony of textures and flavors. Perfect as a light appetizer or a vibrant side, this recipe showcases the best of seasonal ingredients, making it an ideal addition to any summer spread. 



<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<em>Serves 4 </em>

3 courgettes 
2 tsp fine salt 

<strong>Dressing</strong>

2 tbsp red wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar 
1 garlic clove
6 tbsp olive oil 
1 tsp agave 
handful of mint 
cracked black pepper 

<strong>Tofu ricotta </strong>

1 pack silken tofu 
1 lemon 
1 tbsp oil
salt 

Serve with 100-150g savoury granola 

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

1. Cut the courgettes into desired chunks. In a colander, sprinkle over the salt and toss. Toss a few times over the course of 10 minutes. 

2. To make the dressing, finely grate the garlic and add all ingredients but the mint to a bowl and whisk. Smack the mint against the side to release it's flavour and add to the bowl. Set aside. 

3. In a frying pan (ideally cast iron, but any will do), heat up 2 tbsp oil, once hot, add the courgettes to high heat making sure that all courgettes have some surface on the frying pan. If the pan is too small, do this step in two batches. Make sure you move them around so you can a browning on each side. Reduce the heat to low and cover for a couple of minutes. Use a fork to decide if the courgettes are soft enough for you (approximately 10-15 minutes) 

4. Add the courgettes to a bowl with the dressing and leave to rest for 10-15minutes 

5. while the courgettes are resting, zest the lemon and add it to a blender with the silken tofu. Squeeze out 3/4 of the lemon and while on a low speed, add the lemon juice and oil. Pour onto the plate to create a bed for the courgettes to rest on. 

6. Remove the large parts of mint from the bowl and place the courgettes with the juices onto the tofu. Season with salt and the last parts of lemon juice. Use a tbsp of oil, this could be olive oil, or a chilli oil could work well around the plate. And serve.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/recipe-blueberryicecream.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> An icecream flavoured with summer berries, earl grey tea and dandilion honey. Blend coconut and your favourite plant based milk with vanilla, make a blueberry or bilberry puree. Freeze separately then layer up and swirl, or use an icecream maker, creating a lovely berry ripple ice, perfect as an accompaniment to a sweet tart or enjoyed on its own as a summery treat.



<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

2 cans full fat coconut milk
120ml plant based milk
100g dandelion honey/honey/agave
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 earl grey teabags
225g bilberries/blueberries
optional: 2 tbsp coconut sugar

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method"]

In a saucepan, add the full fat coconut milk, plant based milk, earl grey tea bags and dandelion honey over a medium heat. Whish together until well combined and it comes to a light simmer. Please please please do not boil, gentle rolling simmer is what you're looking for.

Taste it. if you want more Earl Grey taste, let it stew for a little longer on a low heat. When you've reached your desired taste, remove the teabags.

Transfer to your hi-speed blender (eg, vitamix, nutribullet), and in the vanilla and blend for 30 seconds. Allow this to cool for 15-30 minutes on the side, and then cover and put in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours (until very cold).

Blueberry syrup:
Add the berries and 2 tbsp sugar to a pan over medium head. Mash with a potato masher to get it to thicken to a syrup consistency, and then transfer to a container and fridge.

If you have an ice cream maker, add the ice cream base in accordance with the directions of the machine. Once complete, add half the ice cream to a container, then half the syrup and repeat. Using a knife, create swirling motions through the layers to achieve a ripple.

If you do not have an ice cream maker, divide your ice cream into two containers and place in the freezer. Each hour, check the solidity of your ice cream. Doing this in two containers, rather than 1 large one can speed up the process of freezing.

Once frozen, add a layer of blueberry syrup and repeat. Use a knife to create swirling motions through the layers to achieve a ripple.

Serving suggestions - 150g per person (two scoops),  serves 8.

<title>Recovery and Sleep</title>

<pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 20:17:04 +0000</pubDate>
<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pexels-photo-3933020.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> To be honest the past few weeks have been a little tough. After I ran a marathon the other week I felt completely depleted, physically, emotionally and mentally. I have been trying to claw my energy and enthusiasm back ever since. I felt hungover from exertion and at the same time I felt like I didn’t have time to rest. Having children to look after and a business to run I wasn’t allowing myself the hours I needed to recharge. So as always from a survival point of view, my brain searched for a quick fix, (normally sugar) but this time it was wellness supplements.



I am sucker for anything that claims to make me healthier. So when it comes to supplements you name it, I’ve tried it - from mushroom tea, to liquid gold, to multi vitamins, to smoothie supplements. I was frantically adding my latest one into my basket when I had this light bulb moment. I am constantly looking outside of myself for answers, buying this and reading that, looking, searching.... I realised in that moment that if I stopped looking out, and turned my view within the answer was right there. And it was, all I needed was sleep. I just had to draw a line for bed time at 9.30pm and get some early nights (which we all know is absolutely free!)

Sleep has eluded me for the past 8 years. I have children that still wake in the night and sometimes join me in bed. My mum always said once you have had children you always sleep with one eye half open and I now agree. I rarely get deep sleep and certainly not enough of it. The trouble is the more tired I am from parenting the later I seem to push my bed time. Once the children are finally settled (sometimes as late as 9.12pm) I just don't want to let go of that free evening, as I know as soon as I open my eyes in the morning the next shift (sorry day) starts all over again. I then feel lethargic on waking and the whole cycle continues.

So I have decided that one of the most important things I can do for my health and wellbeing this month is give myself the gift of some decent nights sleep and thats decent nights sleep in a row not a one off.

Here are my top tips to book ending the day in the most beautiful way possible so that going to bed is framed in temptation.

1. Have gorgeous bed linen to dive into. (Always white and always The White Company).
2. Enjoy a brilliant novel that you can get lost in. No more self help books, embrace escapism.
3. Don't eat too late (I work best on a 7pm cut off), your gut microbes need to rest too.
4. Eye mask to black out the light.
5. Lights out by 10pm.

Wish me luck on reclaiming my energy and I hope you find some zzzzzzz this month too.

Aimee says: "I use this as a bed to rest vegan scallops on, but it can also be a great dip, or a side dish." Pictured served with samphire, three cornered leek oil, vegan scallops, dehydrated seaweed and leek flowers.



<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

680g onions, thinly sliced
3 tbsp olive oil 
3 tbsp unrefined sugar 
1/2 tsp salt / smoked salt 
1/2 tsp garlic powder 
1/2 tsp onion powder 
400ml stock 3 tins of white beans, drained and rinsed - cannellini, butter beans etc.

Also could add: 

Chopped rosemary / oregano / sage

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Directions:"]

Warm a pan on medium heat. Add oil and onions. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally. Once the onions soften, add the sugar and salt, garlic and onion powder. Continue to stir occasionally for the next 35-40 minutes.

Separate 1/3 of the onions and set aside. Add the beans to the pan and cover the beans in stock. Allow it to simmer and cook until the beans are soft. Blend with a stick blender, and add more salt if desired. Use the set aside onions to garnish the top of the puree before serving.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/recipe-peppermintbark-sq.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> Aimee's vegan chocolate based treat offers a perfect blend of rich dark chocolate and minty flavours. Sweetened with natural stevia it keeps sugar levels low, a guilt free way to satisfy your sweet tooth. It's surprisingly easy to make whether you're looking for a party treat, a gift for a friend, or an everyday snack. 




<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

230g dairy-free dark chocolate 

2 tablespoons coconut oil melted 

The coconut fat from 1 tin of coconut milk 

½ teaspoon vanilla extract 

1/4 - 1/2 tsp peppermint extract 

1/2 tsp liquid stevia 

1/2 tsp - 1 tsp Superfood Wales wellbeing blend (for colour) 

handful cocoa nibs

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Directions:"]

Place a tin of coconut milk into the fridge, leave it for a couple of hours or overnight for the fat to solidify and seperate. Melt the chocolate and coconut oil in a bain marie (a bowl placed over a pan of gentle simmering water), stir every now and then until melted. Meanwhile, line a large baking tray with parchment, smooth out any creases. Spread chocolate with a spatula into a thin layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Put it in the fridge to set. Take your can of coconut milk out the fridge, and spoon out the fat from the can.

In a food processor, combine all ingredients. Remember, it's best to add a little peppermint at a time. You can always add more, but you can't take away. The same goe with the wellbeing blend. You're looking for a light green colour.

If you need to add a little sweetness, add more stevia.

Once combined. gently spread the light green "frosting" over the top of chocolate. sprinkle some cocoa nibs and put back into the fridge to harden. Once completely dry and set, break bark into pieces and store in an airtight container in the fridge

They are becoming very popular as a healthy alternative to other more sugary drinks and juices. We use them on our retreats as they are not only refreshing but also offer a variety of health benefits. They are made by infusing water with fresh fruits and herbs, and sometimes even spices. The provide a burst of flavour without added calories or chemicals. Whether you're looking to stay hydrated, improve digestion, or simply enjoy a tastier beverage, naturally flavoured water is a delicious addition to your daily routine.



Here are refreshing summer water flavours to try

<h2>Lemon balm and lavender </h2>

The delicate floral fragrance of the lavender is balanced by the mild lemony flavour with a hint of mint. Both calming and refreshing, it has a clean flavour without an overpowering after taste.

<h2>Thyme and strawberry</h2>

This pairing combines sweet fruitiness of ripe strawberries with the earthy aromatic notes of fresh thyme. A harmonious balance that is both refreshing and sophisticated.

<h2>Orange, nectarine and basil </h2>

Zesty orange, succulent nectarine with the fresh herby notes from the basil. This infusion is a delightful citrus medley reminiscent of warm sunny days.

<h2>Blueberry and lemon verbena </h2>

This is a lovely flavour blend of fruity and citrusy. The blueberries give a rich juicy flavour which is complemented by the lemon herbal undertones of the lemon verbena.

<h2>Mint, melon and lime</h2>

Anything with mint instantly reawakens the senses! We love this clever combo of vibrant lime, melon, with it’s mild honey floral flavours, and invigorating fresh mint.

<title>Summer Bircher</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/recipe-summerbircher.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> A super nutritious start to your day our Summer Bircher recipe embraces the flavours of the season. Typically a blend of oats soaked in liquid such as milk or juice mixed with fresh fruit, nuts and seeds, Aimee our retreat chef says “The joy of bircher is that it is very much a choose your own adventure, or what’s in your cupboard at present.” Make it the night before so the oats soak up all the delicious flavours. This recipe gives quantities for 2.



<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

90g oats 
30g chopped nuts/seeds 
1 medium apple/pear,grated 
250ml coconut milk 
100ml apple juice

Option to mix in: 
2-3 Tbsp ground flaxseeds/chai seeds 
2 Tbsp unsweetened dried fruit 
2 Tbsp coconut flakes 
½ tsp Ground cinnamon 
2 tbsp lemon juice 
Handful pomegranate seeds

Topping options: fresh summer fruit such as nectarine, blueberries, gooseberries, strawberries etc. 
Greek yogurt 
Puffed quinoa, puffed rice
Cocoa nibs 
Granola 
Splash of your favourite milk

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method:"]

Start by mixing your dry ingredients together. Add the grated apple or pear, along with the milk and juice. The consistency should be wetter than you want to eat it as the oats and other dry ingredients of your choice will absorb the liquid.

For storage, either put it into one large container and let it rest overnight. In the morning, add your chosen toppings.

Alternatively, for a quick grab and go in the morning, divide the bircher into smaller containers/jars and add your toppings directly into the container.

International Women's Day and Mothers Day all in one week. That calls for a newsletter that celebrates all women!

Whether you are a mother or not, have founded a company or not, celebrate today for simply being you; a beautiful woman, walking this earth, with so much to share and so much to feel.

I don't know about you but does it seems like we are regularly made to feel that we need more of everything to be happy?

More time, more defined abs, more money, more clothes, more likes, more sleep, more plant powered supplements...
<p class="clear">Do you also have that quiet yet nagging voice within that tells you</p>
~ I need to be busier to feel more successful
~ I need to fill every minute of every day to feel it's been a “good day”
~ I cannot possibly slow down
~ The imposter syndrome I feel is valid
~ I don't deserve to shine brightly?

I do. So I think it's about time we change that narrative, even just for one day, and that day is today. If we are talk of having a great day, in my eyes a great day is a day where I have had the luxury of spending it fully aware and conscious.

It's a day where I have created balance between work and play, time to self and time with loved ones that need me.

It's a day where I have noticed that I am multi tasking unsuccessfully and where I have closed my laptop to listen to my child tell me a story that is so important to them.

It’s a day where I have allowed myself to be seen and heard, not just by others but by myself too.

It's a day where I have listened to the feedback my body has given me and not exercised because my back was out.

It's a day where I have felt so angry inside with stress from the constant noise of children bickering that I have taken myself off and sat in their Wendy house, until the red feeling turned to orange, turned to yellow and I could re-enter the situation calmer and more composed.

It's a day where I have felt a lack connection and grounding and headed out for a much needed walk in nature with a few minutes of quiet time sitting upon a hilltop.

It’s all a constant, sometimes exhausting balancing act. But let's take comfort in the knowing that we are all in this messy, yet wonderful life together. Anyone who says their life is perfect is talking B*** S***. Don't even try to strive for the prefect existence, it will leave you tired and unfulfilled. I suggest striving for peace and contentment, and tasting the sweet joy that is finding bliss in the simple moments..... The first sip of coffee!

Take this day to celebrate you and all your perfect imperfections! Love yourself enough to move your body through exercise, love yourself enough to cook a nutritious, satisfying meal, love yourself enough to carve out time just for you, love yourself enough to book that retreat that you’ve been admiring for years, love yourself enough to do absolutely nothing if that is what your body is calling you to do.

HAPPY YOU DAY

with love from Laura x

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignleft border" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/gilly-600x600-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> <em><strong>Have you met The Zest Life’s Lake District Swimming Leader Gilly McArthur? It’s time to dive in with her!</strong></em>

<em>In this guest post Gilly talks about her love of spring as well as the challenges it brings, and shares her invaluable advice for getting the most out of cold water swimming...</em>



<hr style="border-top: solid 1px #eee;" />



Here in Cumbria the wild garlic is beginning to sprout up green shoots through the leaf litter of winter can only mean one thing - Spring is well and truly on its way.

I don’t know about you but this year January seems to have gone on for three months so I absolutely love to see these first signs of spring waking up. Soon the forest behind my house will be a wash with a heady smell of garlic, then the bluebells will pop up and I can’t wait!

Even after all these seasons of winter skin swimming, I find this time of year the most challenging in the water. The ambient air temperature is often far warmer than the water temperature, and I expect the water to be far warmer than it is.

In the autumn months when the water here starts to cool you’d think the same challenge arises, but my mind expects it to be cold. All this spring bird song and longer daylight lulls me into a false sense of security. The water is generally coldest in March across the UK.

So whether you’re coming out of hibernation to start swimming again, are a seasoned winter dipper, or new to this whole swimming malarkey, here are 5 suggestions to enjoy spring swims.

Remember <strong>hydration, sleep </strong>and<strong> stress</strong> can all play a part and how you’re feeling! Mondays swim may be really different to Tuesdays! Never expect it to be the same - and a snowy mountain top is always possible to bring a 3 degree drop in the water, even in April or May.

Come to the water with a <strong>personal risk assessment</strong>. Sounds dull but hear me out. Instead for immediately stripping off to get in, ask yourself “what do I really need right now” and then perhaps whisper that question again. I’m often surprised at the answers that arise when I ask this to myself. Perhaps you thought you needed company, but in fact a few moments in the water just to bobbing around away from the pod is actually what you need! Sometimes on very rare occasions it’s not to swim.

<strong>Focus on your breath</strong>. Spend a minute (it’s only a minute!) down regulating - count to 4 as you breathe in and count to 6 as you breathe out, do this 10 times. That minute of down regulation really will help you get so much more of your dip and leave you a far better person after the water.

<strong>Play</strong> and <strong>share a good word</strong>. Life is short, so have a laugh, order some Bengal spiced tea for after your swim (truly magic) surprise your friends by bringing some cake to the shore. Comment on what is good in the day, share what you are grateful for. Take notice of something joyful. It’s a habit that’s addictive!

<strong>Leave it better</strong> - as Thich Nhat Hanh said. “<em>Everything can begin with you. You are the foundation of any change that will happen in your society</em>” so that crisp packet tucked into the wall, that glass on the shore - take it away, we might not be able to control the state of our water just yet but we can make positive moves to leave it better where we can, and that’s a nice place to be for a spring time dip.

I’ll be up here in the lakes so if you are on the retreats hopefully we can meet - if not you can follow my swims and adventures on instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gillymcarthur/">@gillymcarthur</a>.

Stay safe and enjoy the water,

Gilly

<title>Five Minute Winter Salad</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-minute-winter-salad.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> I am loving this Winter salad, that was honestly thrown together in five minutes and tastes fabulous. The colours are just to die for too! I find it can be hard at this time to eat healthily as I crave warmth and often seek it in food. Do you feel the same? But this salad is so comforting yet light, I feel it ticks all the boxes for a healthy eat and it contains over 11 plants!




There was a time when at this time of year I would restrict myself heavily, drastically reducing my calories in an effort to shift Christmas pounds but now I'm happy to say, things are very different. I know longer count calories, I just count plants instead! Increasing plant consumption feels so much healthier and "normal". No restrictions but indulgence in the good stuff. 

Give this recipe a whirl, it serves 2.

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

Rocket - 1 bag
Avacado - 1 sliced
Cooked beetroot - 1
Broccoli stems - 4
Feta cheese - 1/2 pack
Canellini beans - 1/2 tin drained and rinsed
Red cabbage leaves x 2 - sliced 
Handful dill
Handful toasted mixed seeds
Lemon juice
Extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "Method:"]

Combine everything in a bowl then scatter with the following: 

Squeeze of lemon juice, drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and then salt and pepper to finish.

<em>Did you know seeds count as plants? So a mix of poppy, sunflower and pumpkin seed toasted and sprinkled on top of any salad (as seen here) counts as 3 plants! </em>

<title>Discipline or Motivation, Which Comes First?</title>

<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/discipline-and-motivation.jpg" alt="" width="300" /> I don’t know about you but as the days got darker and shorter I have really struggled to find motivation to exercise and I love exercise! I have been observing the way the Winter has been effecting me, the slowing down, the less energy and I am actually surprised and how I have not reacted to this and forced myself to be a perpetual Summer. Instead I have found myself falling into the flow of Winter and enjoying it.


I have noticed this past year that I am much kinder on myself in general, I don’t know if that is age, wisdom or just a love for self that was never there before but I don’t run as fast or as far if I don’t feel like it. I just appreciate getting out, feeling cold and then coming home and to the warmth, even on Christmas day.

When it comes to staying fit, I find motivation, especially at this time of year, can be fleeting. There are very, very few days when I actually wake up motivated to exercise. Maybe on a glorious early Summers morning when the sun is beaming down and the light dances on the water do I leap out of bed excited to run. Other than that there is an awful lot of procrastination. The amount of talking I do to a) convince myself that I don’t need to run, or b) I’ll go later, or c) it’s too cold and wet and most recently d) it’s too icy you might slip, is hilarious. So you could say that the motivation is often lacking.

That is why I have discipline. I heard once that “discipline eats motivation for breakfast”, and it’s true. If you have a weekly exercise routine, something that is not too much or too complicated that you couldn’t stick to it, you don’t need motivation, you just have to show up. Over the years I have figured out what feels good to me on certain days depending on when I have the children and what is demanded of me that day. It varies from weights in the gym with friends one day, to running outside solo the next, or walking with the family and now to my two rest days which I love! And the latest is going to an early morning yoga class which has been a glorious addition to my weekly routine.

That being said it can still be challenging to keep the discipline. To make it easier in the morning, I have my workout gear laid out in the bathroom before I go to bed and that habit is piggy backed onto cleaning teeth at bed time. So on waking the gear goes straight on. It’s not something else I have to think about and once the gym clothes are on it’s much easier to just throw myself out the door, leaving the mind chattering away thinking about how else to procrastinate. The motivation flows so easily once I get going, ten minutes into running and the energy is flowing.

When I am struggling to motivate I also remember how lucky I am to be able to move and exercise. I often repeat “ I am able to run” or “I am able to workout”, that gratitude soon gets me moving. Or I remember how much my body loves to move. I take my mind to the end of a session and relive those feel good times of walking out the gym having worked out and the rush of happy hormones that flow. “Why would I not want to feel like that again?”

Finally, I often contemplate why do I run. Do you ever wonder why you exercise? The answer for me is always simple - I want to live well. I want to live with out pain or discomfort in my body and to be full of vitality so I can enjoy life. I see running as self care. There is no magic pill we can take to keep us youthful, but if we put the hard work in today hopefully we reap the benefits years down the line. This time of year can bring a lot of pressure to get in shape after a slower festive period, but remember there is no quick way to fitness, so don’t rely on motivation to get you out the door in January, simply find a discipline you love to do, sew it into your week, do it as often you can and stay focused on the long term goal.]]></content:encoded>

So read on for Laura’s top tips for keeping the season light and bright.</em>

One of my favourite winter past times is lighting the fire and taking the time to meditate or listening to a relaxation clip all wrapped up in a cosy blanket. I really have learnt to love the shorter Winter days where the energy of nature is just so still and peaceful. I love to marinade in that feeling and remember that these months too shall pass.


<p class="clear">
&nbsp;
</p>

<h2 class="clear">Lauras Top 10 Winter Self Care Tips</h2>
1. When days feel stressful take yourself off somewhere quiet and lie down with your legs resting up a wall.
2. Don’t feel duty bound to say yes to too many social engagements. If you don't want to go, don't go!
3. Make sure you get plenty of fresh air, even if the weather isn’t the most favourable step outside and move.
4. Load your Christmas dinner plate with green veggies first, then top up with the goodies.
5. Take time to do some journaling, reflect on the year that has past with kindness.
6. Create a photo book of adventures and loved ones from 2023.
7. Make time for fun. I struggle with this but I will make a big effort to play board games.
8. Take a Boxing day dip. There are organised dips all around the UK and I will be in Deganwy, hopefully dipping there with the family.
9. Browse The Zest Life calendar for 2024 retreats, and book yourself some time to recharge and restore with us.
10. Practise self care - taking long baths, reading in bed, lighting a candle are all such winter joys.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Why Retreat?</title>
<link>https://keepmesnug.co.uk/why-retreat/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://keepmesnug.co.uk/why-retreat/</guid>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 11:36:28 +0000</pubDate>
<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft size-full wp-image-6015" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/why-retreat.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />I often wonder why do we need to retreat? Why bother taking time out for yourself? Is it just a way to while away a few days or is it far more important than that? It always fascinates me how every year, by law, we have to have our cars MOT’d: if they're not road worthy we find the money to fix them to get them back on the road. But when it comes to ourselves, we don't have mandatory MOT’s (which by the way I think we should) and we often keep running ourselves into the ground without stopping...

... until one day we can't get our of bed due to say a back injury, we can’t go to work and then&nbsp;what?

We start to worry about how we might continue with our job and how this might impact us finically and on the downward spiral goes. Is it at this point we begin to wonder whether we should make changes to our daily habits to improve our health? Your health really should be your primary focus, even before the health of your loved ones. If you are sick and diseased how can you look after anyone else? So we say a retreat is more than a few nights sleeping in a comfy bed with white cotton sheets, it's a necessity and we should, all retreat every year.

Having a retreat away from home each year has been a massive piece in my healing jigsaw. I have lived a life of control, pushing and forcing many aspects of my life for so long. This has been reflected in my control of exercise, daily work outs and my inability to have rest days. Sadly so much of my exercise habit was about how many calories I could burn not how much I could enjoy myself. A year on from last October when we were last in the Lake District and I have had out a lot of talking therapy, found security in my mental well-being, experienced more confidence in my own skin, which I believe has led me to finding true love.

On the Lakes swim retreat we enjoyed many beautiful swimming experiences but the first day for more was divine. As I sat acclimatising before entering the water, I was caught off guard by thoughts of the same lake the previous year. I took a moment reflecting back on that day. It was cap and goggles on, straight in, thinking how far can I go, can I do 20 minutes in cold water, will I get to that buoy before I have to get out to help with guests. This year however I was a different person. I took time to get in embracing the sensations, splashing water on my face as I sat on a rock watching the leaves fall silently. Then slipping in, gliding through the silk like water, swimming with my face above the water, which meant I could see the beauty that was all around. I was feeling, I was noticing, I was witnessing. I wasn't just going through the motions. I was checking in in every sense of the word and it was glorious.

A retreat is a much needed opportunity to check in with self. Time flies by, the years race by and before you know it five years has passed. What if you have been on a negative trajectory all that while? Taking a retreat each year is an opportunity to stop and reflect on where you are at. Asking yourself what little changes need to be made so that goals can be achieved long term. I don't mean huge life goals but goals like being able to bounce out of bed each morning with energy, having the calmness of mind to deal with life challenges and having peace and contentment each and every day. It is through these daily wins that allow the huge life goals to graciously fall into place.

Is it time you invested in self?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--<img class="border alignleft" width="300" alt="" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vegan-Banana-Peanut-Butter-Bread.jpg">-->A spiced tea favorite transformed into a soft, frosted, date-sweet slice--this healthy Chai Spiced Quick Bread is the perfect cozy sweet treat! Vegan, gluten-free, oil-free. It’s kind of like a malt loaf. If you don’t need it to be GF you can easily put normal flour in instead of the GF flour, but I would still use the oat flour as it is very tasty.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

12 pitted medjool dates
1 cup prepared chai tea
1 1/4 cup oat flour *
¼ cup Gluten free flour
1/4 cup nondairy milk
2 tsps baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp lemon juice
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp cardamom**
1/4 tsp cloves

*<em>You can easily make your own oat flour by blitzing rolled oats in a good blender or food processor.</em>

** <em>I find pre-ground cardamom hard to find and less potent than fresh from a pod. So I took the seeds out of a couple of cardamom pods and, as I have a good blender, blitzed it up at the same time as I did the wet ingredients.</em>

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "instructions"]

Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.

Pour the chai tea over the dates and soak for 10 minutes.

Blend the chai tea,dates, lemon juice, non-dairy milk, and vanilla on high until smooth.

In a large mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients and mix briefly.

Add the date mixture. Stir to combine.

Lightly oil or line a loaf tin and pour in your batter, smoothing out the top.

Bake for 35 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.

Cool completely before slicing. Keep in the fridge.

Best served spread with butter/vegan spread.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--<img class="border alignleft" width="300" alt="" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vegan-Banana-Peanut-Butter-Bread.jpg">-->This dessert is a mixture between an Aero and and After Eight, but it's vegan and refined sugar free! It makes a lovely light finish to an evening meal. I like to cut into small squares and serve with coffee after dinner. But on retreat it was the main desert and cut into larger slices for an indulgent chocolate treat.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

<strong>For the base</strong>

3/4 cup / 107g raw cashew nuts
3/4 cup / 70g unsweetened desiccated coconut
3 tbsp / 21g cocoa powder
1/8 tsp fine sea salt
3 tbsp / 45ml / 42g coconut oil, softened
3 tbsp / 45ml / 60g maple syrup
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
<strong>
For the mint filling</strong>

1 cup / 143g raw cashew nuts
8 tsp / 40ml / 30g coconut cream
1/4 cup / 60ml / 54g coconut oil, melted
2 tbsp / 12g unsweetened desiccated coconut
2 tbsp / 30ml / 40g maple syrup
5-15 drops pure peppermint oil (see Note 1)
1/3 cup / 12g baby spinach leaves, for green color
For the topping

3.5oz / 100g dark chocolate
8 tsp / 40ml / 38g coconut oil


&nbsp;

[tabby title= "instructions"]

Method

1. Place the cashew nuts for the mint filling in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Allow to soak for 1 hour (see Note 2).

2. While the cashew nuts are soaking, prepare the base by blending the cashew nuts for the base and the desiccated coconut in a blender until the mixture starts to clump together. Tip the mixture into a bowl add the remaining base ingredients. Stir until well combined (see Note 3).

3. Line a 10 x 20 cm / 4 x 8 inch loaf tin with baking paper (see Note 4). Tip the base mixture into the tin, pressing it out evenly with the back of a spoon. Set aside in the freezer to chill.

4. Once the cashew nuts have finished soaking, drain them and place in a blender or food processor with the remaining mint filling ingredients. Blend until smooth. Taste and add more peppermint if desired.

5. Tip the mint filling onto the base and smooth it out evenly with the back of a spoon. Return to the freezer to chill.

6. Make the topping by melting the chocolate in the microwave or using a double boiler. Stir in the coconut oil until you get a smooth mixture. Pour the mixture over the mint filling, using the back of a spoon to ensure that it’s evenly covering the slice. Chill in the freezer for 1 hour or until the mint filling is firm and the chocolate topping is set.

7. Once firm, cut into pieces. You can let the slice sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to soften slightly before cutting.

<title>Learning emotional intelligence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft size-large" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog-Learning-emotional-intelligence-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />How often do you share your feelings with those around you? Or how often do you suppress what you really feel for fear of how it will be received? Learning to express your emotions is a valuable part of being an evolved human being. We no longer need to roam the earth grunting at each other and clubbing each other around the head. We are intelligent beings and have developed intricate words to express in great detail how we feel. Its through this expression that our world becomes safe. It’s so important to put words to our emotions and then be able to convey them to those around us.

Emotional intelligence is like learning another speaking language. You don’t suddenly go to France and expect to speak French. You practice before you go, maybe for years. You go through your oral conversations with your tutor, you study the vocab and how to say the words, so that way when you arrive on holiday you are fully equipped with the language to meet the demands of the situations you might encounter. So why do we think that we will have the vocabulary to discuss a struggling relationship or a trying friendship if we haven’t practiced sharing how we feel beforehand? Learning the words that help you express how you feel and having deeper conversations with people in your life is a key part of emotional intelligence. For example instead of just saying “I feel sad”, can you express the emotion in a more detailed way, are you lonely, feeling isolated, embarrassed, hurt, guilty, vulnerable…..

You see, I believe we have to practice this emotional language on a daily basis. We are not taught emotional intelligence as children. We don’t grow up and suddenly expect to know how to convey our feelings and emotions with others and be able to hold others when they are in crisis. In fact it’s more the opposite. Being an emotionally intelligent person takes time and doesn’t just happen, it has to be learnt and then practiced. Practiced with those that you feel emotionally safe with and if you have no one in your life that provides a safe emotional space for you, it might mean talking to a therapist. When you share your daily emotions, such as gratitude, love, happiness, stress, tiredness, when life gets more challenging you are then more capable of sharing the more difficult emotions. The feelings of hurt, betrayal, jealousy, resentment. They are much harder to share than those of happiness. You don’t have to hold onto negative feelings and have them sit in your body. If you are feeling hurt by someone’s behaviour, let them know or share it with someone else first. If someone is adding to your life in a hugely positive way, let them know too. Sometimes expressing love and joy can feel very vulnerable, but they are exciting emotions to practice opening up to.

I find it easiest to start with the emotions that come freely, the love and the joy. I tell me children I love them all the time, I share my positive and negative feelings with my wonderful boyfriend so openly and freely and it feels wonderful to speak from the heart. Ask yourself when was the last time you truly expressed to a loved one how they made you feel? Why not tell some one close to you how much you love them, how they make you feel when you are with them? Can you revel in the feeling of joy?

Also, another way to learn to vocalise your emotions is to begin with people that don’t have such a strong emotional connection with you. Are you able to speak your truth to a stranger when they do something you don’t agree with. For example, I used to struggle with trades people coming into my house and walking their muddy boots up the stairs. I would want to say “Please can you take them off”, but I didn’t want to upset them or create and awkward situation so I never spoke my mind. Now I am able to voice my feelings and ask guests to take their shoes off when they come into my house. It feels empowering to be able to speak your truth.

It's about taking smalls steps. It’s not about making grand gestures with loved ones, or yelling at everyone from your past that has ever caused you pain. Simple begin to get in tune with how you feel, you may need to take some quiet time to reflect, sit and just be and be curious as to what comes up. You may feel the emotion on a physical level, lightness in your chest, anxiety in your belly. Remember you hold your issues in your tissues, so try and share these feeling with someone. You do not need to keep emotions suppressed in the body. Speak your truth and you will feel so much lighter in your life. You will feel space in your heart where so many great things can flow in.]]></content:encoded>

coconut oil, for greasing (optional)
80ml maple syrup
4 ripe bananas, mashed
100g coconut oil, melted
1tsp vanilla extract

[tabby title= "instructions"]

Method

1. Preheat the oven to 170C. Grease a loaf tin with coconut oil or line with baking paper.

2. Put the maple syrup, mashed banana, coconut oil, vanilla and sugar in a large bowl and mix well. In another bowl, stir together the flour, chia seeds, baking powder, bicarb and salt. Tip the flour mixture into the wet mixture in the first bowl and stir together well.

<title>Minted Pea &amp;#038; Watercress Soup</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/recipe-minted-pea-watercress-soup2-sq-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="border alignleft size-large wp-image-5348" />Here is another delicious recipe from our retreat chef Cathy. This healthy green soup is great for spring with all these lovely fresh flavours. We think the fresh mint is a perfect match. You can use fresh or frozen peas and watercress can be replaced with spicy salad leaves of your choice. Serve with warm sourdough bread and finish with micro greens and a chilli oil drizzle.



<h2>ingredients</h2>
Makes 4/5 portions
1 bunch of watercress, large (washed)
800ml of vegetable stock – I use Bouillon 
2 tbsp of olive oil
1 large onion, finely chopped
5/6 celery sticks, roughly chopped
1 potato, cubed
1 bunch of fresh mint, roughly chopped
400g of shelled peas, fresh or frozen

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "instructions"]
	
Method

Coarsely chop the watercress, stalks and all, and place in a small saucepan with the stock. Bring to a simmer for 5 minutes, and then remove from the heat and leave to infuse

Heat the oil in a large pan and add the onion. Cook on a low heat until softened but not coloured. Add the potato, stir, cover and cook until soft about 10 minutes. Add the mint, peas and watercress and finally the stock. Season and simmer for 2 minutes

Place the soup in a blender and purée, then return the soup to the saucepan (you can strain the soup through a sieve if you like, to get rid of any tough-to-blend stalky bits, but if you have a powerful blender like a Vitamix, it should be able to purée everything into a silky smooth soup)

Serve with crusty sourdough, drizzle with chilli oil and top with micro greens for that 5* finish

These two seasonal vegetables are a lovely combination, enhanced with the simple addition of garlic and herbs. While celariac has celery-like, earthy notes, cauliflower is milder with a cabbage taste, together their sweeter nuttier flavours create a creamy richness in this hearty soup perfect for those colder days.





<h2>ingredients</h2>

1 cauliflower
1 celeriac
2 white onions
Vegetable stock – Bouillon personal recommendation
4 thyme sprigs
3 garlic cloves and pepper to taste
1 tsp French mustard – optional

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "instructions"]

Trim the cauliflower and peal the celeriac – roughly chop both into equal sizes

Slice the onions and peal the garlic

In a large pan heat some oil, first add the onions and sweat for 5 minutes until the begin to colour, than add the cauliflower and celeriac, fry for a further 5 minutes adding the garlic, mustard and thyme half way through.

Now prepare you stock by adding approx 1 liter or until everything is covered in liquid, simmer for about 25 minutes until the vegetable are completely soft. Transfer to a food blender or use a stick blender too get a rich and creamy texture.

If the mixture is too thick then add oat/soya milk to thin, season to taste and enjoy 

Chefs top tip – drizzle with a parsley oil and grated fresh nutmeg and serve with warm garlic sourdough

<title>Top 10 inspirational poems</title>

<category><![CDATA[Poetry]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft size-large wp-image-5058" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pexels-suzy-hazelwood-1526049-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /> I haven’t always loved poetry... as a young girl I thought it was a waste of time. I took extra drama in school and I would much rather have been playing out my friends than having to go to the one to one lessons reciting poetry.

Then in my twenties I started to write poetry as a way of expressing myself. Trying to get my feelings, which were often desperation, out and onto paper. I felt that when they were out of my body they were somewhere away from me and therefore heard. And through writing poetry I started reading poetry again. 

This time around though, it was poems that inspired my heart and mind and truly resonated with me. Ancient yogis, thought leaders, inspired women who felt they all had something to say was what I wanted to hear more of. Poems that helped me navigate life, with all its love and loss. I could never have imagined how the stringing of certain words together could mean so much, triggering so much emotion and sounding so beautiful in ones head.

Here are favourite poets and my top ten poems that I have read over and over again. In no particular order, I just hope you are inspired by them as much as I am.
 
<h2>Rupi Kaur</h2>

An incredible young woman, born in Punjab India and raised in Canada. She writes about love, loss, abuse and racial discrimination. She's only 30 but is now a global sensation. I came across her work completely by chance one cold, December day as I dived into Waterstones in Manchester to escape the rain. There was her book "Milk and Honey" as the recommended read of the day. I curled up and read it cover to cover in one sitting and was mesmerised. She's written four books, I have them all! 

Most importantly love
like its the only thing you know how
at the end of the day all this
means nothing
this page
where you’re sitting
your degree
your job
the money
nothing even matters
except love and human connection
who you loved
and how deeply you loved them
how you touched the people around you
and how much you gave them

I need someone
who knows struggle 
as well as I do
someone
willing to hold my feet in their lap
on days its too difficult to stand
the type of person who gives
exactly what I need
before I even know I need it
the type of love who hears me
even when I do not speak
is the type of understanding I demand

I do not want to have you 
to fill the empty parts of me
i want to be so complete
I could light a whole city
and then
I want to have you 
cause the two of us combined
could set in on fire

<h2>Pablo Neruda</h2>

He was a Chilean Poet and politician, who died in the 70’s, aged 69. He wrote a wide variety of poetry but I love his love poems and sonnets. I just imagine him as young man, completely sick with love and writing such beautiful poetry in an attempt to help him feel closer to his loved one.

Then you realise,
it's not the one who moves the ground beneath you,
but the one who centers you.
It’s not the one who steals your heart, 
but the one who makes you feel as if you have it back.

I love you without knowing 
how, or when or where.
I love you simply, without
problems or pride: I love
you in this way because I 
do not know any other way
of loving but this, in which
there is no I or you, so 
intimate that your hand
upon my chest is my hand, 
so intimate that when I 
fall asleep your eyes close.

Everything carries
me to you
as if everything
that exists
aromas, lights, metals, 
were little boats
that sail toward
those isles of yours
that wait for me.
 
<h2>Oriah Mountain Dreamer </h2>

I cannot remember how or where I came across this poem but it has been a go to poem for me for so many years. I think I was first fascinated just by her name, Mountain Dreamer, isn’t it wonderful? Oriah is an American story teller and has written several international bestsellers. The focus of her life and work has been an on-going inquiry into the Sacred Mystery. 

Her writing, teaching and personal journey all explore how we can each become the individual we are at the deepest level of being and how we can co-create meaning together in the world. This poem brings me to tears most times I read it and its values are embedded in my day to day living.

<img src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/poetry-Oriah-Mountain-Dreamer-772x1024.gif" alt="" width="772" height="1024" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5290" />

<h2>Rumi</h2> 

Rumi was a 13th century Persian poet. Rumi's influence transcends national borders and ethnic divisions. His poems have been widely translated into many of the world's languages. I first came across his work in my yoga circles but whether you are into a yogi way of life or not his words are extremely profound.

<h3>The Guest house</h3>

This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival 

A joy, a depression, a meanness
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture.
still, treat each guest honourably.
He maybe clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the same, the malice, 
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes, 
because each has been sent 
as a guide from beyond.

<h2>Hollie MCnish </h2>

An award winning UK based poet and writer. I came across her work by chance on YouTube, she was performing this incredible piece about pregnancy and motherhood, and how phenomenal the female body is yet how it is so unseen. She is so fearless in her writing and an essential voice for modern times, especially for women. We need to hear more truth and she shouts it out there so beautifully.

<h3>Making Love</h3>

Cheapest room in the hotel
no windows on the wall
but the bath was hot and full and you were in it.

Smiling, silhouetted
lips already sweating
arms curving out a space where I should sit

and so I stripped, lay back against you
shadows steaming, saying nothing,
occasionally kissing as we hugged

How strange it is I thought
as we dried our gasping bodies
that this is not considered making love

<h2>Maya Angelou</h2>

An American poet and civil rights activist who died in 2014 in her 80s. Her work spanned 50 years and she has won a number of awards. Her autobiography "I know why the Caged Bird Sings" bought her international acclaim as a writer.  She really was and still is a true inspiration. I have not read a lot of her work but the work I have shines so brightly for me.

<h3>Alone</h3>

“Lying, thinking
last night
How to find my soul a home
When water is not thirsty
And bread loaf is not stone
I came up with one thing
And I don't believe I am wrong
That nobody, 
But nobody
Can make it out here alone."

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/House01-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="border alignleft size-large wp-image-5294" />In my twenties I used to work as a stewardess on yachts, sailing and crusing around the Caribbean and the Mediterranen. It sounds glamorous doesn’t it but it was actually one of the lowest times of my life. That aside, I remember crossing the Atlantic to Portugal which took about 14 days via the Azores, then flying home to wales to see family, finally coming back from sea after months of being away.



I will never forget the first morning I woke up on my return, I was at my parents farm here in Wales, it was Spring time and I had the window open a jar and all I could hear as I stirred from my slumber was the sound of the sweetest bird song. I was transfixed, lying their listening to this sing song, a sound that I had not heard or paid attention to for weeks maybe even months. Gosh it was incredible. You don't hear birds when you are out at sea, waves lapping and the odd sea gull yes, but no excited chirping from garden birds in Spring.

I now always play close attention to the sound of the birds. When I walk with my children and they are getting bit rambunctious I find myself saying “Ohh what's that sound, listen” and they do generally slow down. We stop to listen and we then look for the birds. If you listen carefully enough the birds tell you exactly what is going on in nature. Spring is here and oh they sound so busy at the moment, it's like they are calling each other in to get going.

Taking time out to notice and listen to the world around you is such a great skill to develop. Being curious to sounds is a form of mindfulness and an opportunity to drop spright into the present moment. Whether the sounds are pleasant or unpleasant, near or far, tune into them for a minute. It works for kids and it works for us adults too. Listening to the birds and their sweet song at this time of the year will be music to your ears, and this in turn will reduce your stress levels and create a greater sense of peace and clarity for you.]]></content:encoded>

It's a no bake raw food recipe so packed full of trace elements, nutrients and enzymes to boost digestion, immunity and general health. A lovely healthy treat!



<h2>ingredients</h2>

<strong>The crust</strong>

3/4 cup raw cashews
3/4 cup walnuts
12 Medjool dates pitted &amp; soaked in boiling water
A pinch sea salt

<strong>Lemon topping</strong>

3 medium ripe bananas see notes
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
3/4 cup coconut oil
4 lemons juiced
2 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or 1/8 teaspoon vanilla bean powder

&nbsp;

[tabby title= "instructions"]

In a food processor, combine and pulse together nuts and dates. Do this for about 1 minute until well combined or until everything forms a paste-like texture. You should be able to take your fingers and press the mixture against the side of the processor, as it will hold together and resemble a crust.

Transfer mixture to a parchment-lined square pan (8”x8” works well) and press it down onto the bottom and slightly up the edges.

Rinse the food processor and dry it. Pulse together the lemon topping ingredients. The mixture will turn into a milkshake-like texture.

Pour mixture over the crust, Cover the dish with cling film and let the bars set in the freezer for 24 hours.

When you are ready to eat them, take them out the freezer about 30 minutes before hand and cut into squares with a knife after running it under hot water. Served chilled with fresh fruit and a dusting of icing powder

Store in the freezer for up to 3 months.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/plas-cadnant-spring-gardens.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="border alignleft size-full wp-image-5195" /> One of the challenges in our 28 day wellbeing calendar is to read. I used to think that having the time to pick up a book and actually read was a luxury. Something that I saved for a holiday, or Christmas time when work was quiet. I no longer see reading as a luxury, it’s a daily priority and part of my wellbeing. 



I love to read. Each and every day I ring fence time in bed to read, even if it's just a few minutes before sleep. I read actual books, not on kindle or I pad and I don’t listen to them on audio either. I like how the book feels and smells and it's heaviness in my hands as I start to tire, and the words almost blurring before I drift off.

Another favourite place to read is outside in the garden. In the spring and summer I set my alarm half and hour earlier to enjoy this still time of the day in the garden. Keeping another book down stairs offers me the opportunity, when the children are quiet and my cup of tea is still warm to sneak outside finding a relaxing chair to curl up in. I might only manage a couple of pages before I am found or needed but still I can say “I read my book in the garden today’.

The other day I was driving though a village near me, where there are some small bungalows right on the roadside. They don’t really have gardens, they simply have a communal grass area infront of their house with a low fence around to divide them from the road. They are open and exposed and really in my eyes the last place you would want to sit out. But anyway I couldn’t help but notice one owner had put a little bench there. She had it angled towards the morning sun was sitting with a cup of tea, her face turned to the sun and yes, a book. It was cool out but the sun was bright and I had such a warm smile cross my face as I thought of her enjoying that simple pleasure of bench, book, tea and sun.

We often feel that our lives are not enough and it’s only when we achieve or get certain things that we can then start being happy. “ When I get my summer garden furniture and have my patio paved and everything looks Instagram worthy then I can sit out and read and have cups of tea.” What I am saying is, is that day may never come, the only time we have is this moment, here and now. So do not put off to tomorrow what you can start enjoying today. Today is a gift, and you might not be here tomorrow.

So as your precious days become brighter, find an outside space public or private, regardless of where you live or what state your garden is in, find some where you can sit. Then take a book and a drink of choice and enjoy five minutes of peace with your face to the sun. Life is made up of all the tiny moments and how you show up to each of those dictates the entire course of your life. Let that course be bright, nourished and positive.

February, the month of love. Yes it is often associated with the romantic commercial type of love but for me this month is a beautiful reminder of my love for nature. I have often wondered where and when this love was sparked. I know that this love is vital to me and I have a huge appreciation for the seasons, as honouring them and learning from their overcharging flow has been a massive part of my healing journey.

I grew up on a farm, surrounded by beautiful hills here in Wales. We had the joy of living next to my grandparents and my grandfather Baba, was a farmer. I have fond memories of him and his sheepdogs working the land and the livestock. 



The combine harvesters that would come in summer to cut the crops, the feeding of the lambs in Spring, the tending to the land in winter. These were all seasonal milestones that never changed, from that routine there came such comfort. There was such a feeling of freedom and space out on the farm.

Then there was my grandmother Bess, who took such pleasure in her garden. At this time of year she loved to walk around the garden with her cats, looking for those first sweet signs of spring: the crocus, the snow drops. For pocket money she’d pay us to dead head her daffodils, a £1 a bucket and it was a big bucket! In Summer we would help (actually hinder thinking about it now) in her greenhouse. It always smelt of tomatoes, there was always a sense of ease there. Her garden represented happiness, play, joy and laughter. In gardens you can run free.

Then my father, his love was and still is, woodland and being amongst trees. A day out for the family would be tromping to the wood, having hot chocolates, probably a camp fire, then planting trees (this was unpaid!). The woodland and the trees are still there today. As you stand in a woodland you feel the trees standing majestically still watching over you, there is a stillness so great in a woodland. Different birds sing in the woods to the garden, they don't really sing, they call and croak out. Even now as I return to the same woods, I often stand and absorb the quiet, I want those qualities of the wise old trees to be reflected in my bones.

Last but by no means least Mum, she too loved her garden. So many happy days spent being outside as a child with her as she pottered, planted and planned her garden. We ran wild, oh the freedom we had, it was heavenly. Mum always jumped for joy at the first signs of Spring, forever telling us to watch out for the bulbs coming through as we careered around our bikes. As the warmer months began she would note the first signs of the Swallows in her diary, that day representing the arrival of Summer. I now do the same.

So the four greatest pillars of my upbringing were lovers of nature. The all found there emotional regulation outside. So it's no wonder that I do to. It brings me such joy now to share that with my children. I might not have the luxury of raising them on a farm with woodland but nature is all around. With the lighter mornings we have starting visiting the park before school for a brisk bike ride or walk. That blast of air on our faces and fresh air in our lungs is our therapy. We are spotting the bright daffodils, the crocus that are coming up and listening to the sound of the happy birds.

We humans are all a part of nature, sometimes we lose sight of that and we just have to keep finding our paths back to it. Being in tune with it, discovering places where there is no resistance allows us to feel peace, ease and flow.

<em>I ask you have you seen your first Snowdrop? If not come and visit us here on a retreat and you will see them in abundance.</em>

<em>Finding space in your space - 10 tips for how to store your Christmas decorations</em>

One of my favourite days in the year is the day we (I) take down Christmas decorations. Don't get me wrong I love Christmas and making it special for the children is such a joy but I am really not a huge fan of all the stuff. Christmas and a more minimal way of life don't really go together, so I do find having all the decorations up quite a challenge. Especially when the children want them up so early, I hold out until December but even then it seems a long time to have a large tree in you front room.



Advent calendars for the children seem to take up space too. They are no longer the slim pieces of cardboard with pictures behind that I had as a child. Oh no they are large boxes that have to housed for for 25 days! They always seem to be in the way. Don't get me started on the 25 pieces of plastic tat that invariably end up lost or in the bin. This year I actually gave the calendars to my lovely elderly neighbour Bryan to look after or should I say manage! He doesn’t mind them being in his house and it's a lovely excuse for the children to visit him each day after school. He gets the company and I get the space in my living room. Win Win!

Having this extra stuff in the house makes me think of this lovely children's book by <em>Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler</em> called <em>A Squash and A Squeeze</em>. It's about a little old lady who complains to a wise old man that her house is too small. He’s suggests to bring in all her farm animals, then one by one he says to take them all out. After having her house filled with a chicken, a goat, a pig and a cow her house then feels enormous, she feels happy and grateful and she does a little jig! It’s an inspiring read for all ages.

So when the day comes to take down all the Christmas paraphernalia and pack it all away (usually January 1st) there is a huge sense of relief. I feel a great sense of space and freedom in my home once again, and yes it too makes me want to do a little jig!

On this decluttering, clear out day, these are my top tips for storing away your Christmas decorations:
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
 	<li>Never let children get involved. They just make more mess and double the amount of time you need to get this job done.</li>
 	<li>Have plenty of good storage boxes of different sizes. Egg boxes and shoe boxes make great storage containers for baubles.</li>
 	<li>Use clear resealable bags if you have coloured baubles you like to keep separate.</li>
 	<li>Throw away anything that got broken or damaged this year. There is no need to hold on to broken ornaments.</li>
 	<li>Pay lots of attention to packing lights away carefully and untangled. Save yourself the hassle of unravelling them next year. If you no loner have their box, wrap them around some heavy duty cardboard.</li>
 	<li>Recycle all Christmas cards or save the cute ones cutting the pictures up ready to make Christmas tags for presents next year.</li>
 	<li>Recycle your real Christmas tree. If you have an open fire, saw of all the branches to use as kindling or contact your local authority to arrange a collection.</li>
 	<li>See the job through to the end. Don’t lump everything in a heap and leave on the landing or in your hallway, you know it might remain there for weeks. Put it all away in the loft, the garage, the shed or wherever. and get the job done.</li>
 	<li>You might even find yourself wanting to have a bit more of a clear out, a cupboard maybe or the kids toy chest. If that's not the case, then maybe it’s a quick vacuum where the tree once was and the rearranging of the furniture back to it's usual place.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
Then once everything is packed and out the way, sit back and enjoy your new found clear space.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4750 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TZL-Nov-posts.png" alt="digital-distractions" width="300" height="300" data-wp-editing="1" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was chatting with a friend the other day about the shift that we all take into Winter. She commented on how it had taken longer this year to get there, to that place of acceptance and joy of the Winter months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was relieved to hear this as I too have found this year’s winter transition a struggle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the incredibly mild October we had was partly to blame and the last retreat we did mid-November was so warm and I remember thinking I wished I'd packed shorts! But thank goodness as we move into December it has now turned cold. </span>



<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have enjoyed lighting the fire, getting out my woolly jumper and thick socks, reading more, and just generally feeling wintery. But one of the greatest joys I have about winter is the night sky.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to hate the darkness and don't get me wrong, some days when I am home indoors with the children and bathing them at 4.30 pm just for something to do, I wish there was more sunshine. But oh, how we appreciate that light when the spring comes around. Obviously, in the summer we don't get that lovely feeling of darkness. We don't see as many sunrises and sunsets either, but the winter sky delivers on so many levels. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my coping techniques to navigate an evening where I might be feeling overwhelmed is to simply step outside into the garden and look up. I will have invariably gotten overheated from raised tension with the children, so stepping out into the cold calms both my mind and body. I have myself a little sensory moment of witnessing the cool breeze against my skin. Even if it's raining, I might stand out for a minute and feel the rain on my skin. For me though the best bit is what my eyes take in. The night sky. Just looking up with complete awe. I live in an urban area so it's not always very starry but there is always something to see, the clouds with the moon gleaming behind, or the moon itself shining bright with a halo of light. Seeing space stops me in my tracks and makes me realise how small I am in this universe and how insignificant my worries are. It makes me mentally stop and pause, realising that none of the stress matters, the job, the work strain, the family and motherhood pressure, none of it really matters. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the beautiful poet Rupi Kaur has said “nothing even matters except love and human connection, who you loved and how deeply you loved them, how deeply you touched the people around you and how much you gave them”. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> So, this Christmas when you might be feeling physically trapped indoors, overwhelmed or frustrated emotionally, pop a cosy coat on, make a warm drink, step outside and look up in awe. Breathe, feel, be curious as to what comes up, and know that whatever you are feeling know you are not alone. And as you begin to feel in awe of the night sky, be in awe of yourself and all that you are capable of, as you too are a miracle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wishing you all a very festive December. I hope it’s filled with beautiful times spent with family and friends. Wrap up, walk, laugh, and of course LOVE. </span>]]></content:encoded>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it, we <em>all</em> spend too much time on our phones. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They beg for attention with notifications and pop-ups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All it takes is for your hand to drift towards your phone, and then minutes (or even hours!) later. you find that you’ve been doom scrolling through Tik Tok or, Instagram.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that excessive mobile phone use can have negative effects on our mental health. It can affect your sleeping habits, your social life, and lower your self-esteem. It’s time we all set boundaries!</span>



&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our phones are constantly taking us away from the real world. It means we often miss out on precious moments of life in favour of looking at a screen. So, how can you use your phone less and spend more time experiencing the little things?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Structured screen time </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A bit of screen time now and then isn’t a bad thing. In fact, our phones and tablets are great for keeping in touch with friends and family, using guided meditation apps, doing your banking, reading the news, etc. By setting times where you allow yourself screen time can regulate your usage. This will make the time you do spend on your phones more meaningful, and stop you giving in to instant gratification. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Do not disturb </b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not taking full advantage of the do not disturb setting on your phone, you definitely should be! It’s the perfect way to keep your phone quiet while you spend time on your wellbeing. For example, if you’re meditating but find your phone’s buzzing takes you out of the moment, you can set do not disturb mode up so you can have complete focus. Your phone may even be able to have scheduled do not disturb times if you want to build a structure. Try it out to help keep your focus on you. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>The five more rule</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you find yourself losing focus, try using the rule of five. Five more minutes, five more pages, five more exercises. This can help give you a focus and a target to stay on task. You may even find you end up doing more than that! Giving yourself small, simple tasks is much easier and less daunting than a big, long task!</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Meditate</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meditation is a great tool to help keep you focused. It’s not always external factors that distract us, it can also be the mind trying to distract itself. Meditation can help you allow those thoughts to pass like a cloud, allowing you to stay on track with what you’re doing. Practice meditation everyday to help make the act of allowing thoughts to pass easier. As a bonus, this is a great tool to help with mental health. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Put on some music</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find your mind keeps wandering to your phone, certain sounds and music can help keep you focused! There’s a reason we play music when we practice yoga on retreat. Classical and lo-fi music, or sounds from nature, are great soothing background noises that allow your brain to focus, or keep you calm, and more importantly, less likely to pick up your phone.</span>

I don't know about you, but the pressure that this time of year brings starts to fill me with dread. Why is there this need to book exciting events with the children, plan family outings, parties with colleagues, shopping days out with friends, hair appointments… the list goes on. It literally makes me want to run away and hide. Do you feel the same?

It's almost as if our success and happiness is based on how busy we are and the navigation of the festive season seems to be the ultimate symbol of how well we are coping at life. 

&nbsp;

When asked how you are, how often is your answer something along these lines: “Things are great, I am/we are just so busy”. Whether that’s busy in life, work, with the children or just in general. It's almost as if we believe we will get more praise and recognition for being busy.

Any sort of rush can make me feel anxious, even if it's the school run, or simply trying to fit too many things into the already full day. So, feeling like things are to get even more hectic over the coming months is a nightmare. But, I have come to realise that this lead-up to Christmas does not have to be stressful. I have started to work really hard at not being busy. Simply saying “No” to invites is a helpful start. Of course, I do everything that needs to be done to look after my children, run my business and keep my life happy, but I no longer try and fill every last empty hour with something just so that I can say "I am so busy". I have started to enjoy the empty times and I am really learning to focus on rest and its importance. I love it when I can answer by saying I have had a quiet, simple day, doing whatever it is I need to do to feel nurtured and loved.

On that note, I was thinking that we don't really get taught how to rest. It isn't something we learn as children and it is sad to think that when our children see us flapping around like crazy chickens, they learn that behaviour too.

Quite recently, I had a document sent to me that highlighted the different types of rest. It was such an eye-opener. I always thought resting was taking a nap (which I never get time to do) but actually, it comes in many forms. I am drawn to Ecological and Sensory rest - taking a long hot bath after a freezing swim in the sea is my ultimate rest!
<h2>Different types of rest</h2>
<strong>Physical Rest</strong> - Naps, calming breathwork, gentle yoga, etc.
<strong>Cognitive Rest</strong> - Non-thinking activities such as gardening, baking, etc.
<strong>Sensory Rest</strong> - Warm baths, loose clothing, massage, soothing scents. Think about really engaging in the senses.
<strong>Altruistic Rest</strong> - Volunteering, donating, acts of kindness
<strong>Psychosocial Rest</strong> - Solitude, hugs, reading
<strong>Emotional Rest</strong> - Journaling, sharing your feelings, taking breaks from social media, news, etc.
<strong>Spiritual Rest</strong> - Prayer, meditation, anything that connects you to love/ heart
<strong>Playful Rest</strong> - Team sports, watching comedy, board games, etc.
<strong>Ecological Rest </strong>- Time in nature, ocean sounds, nurturing houseplants, etc.
<strong>Creative Rest</strong> - Painting, baking, awe-filled experiences

On reading the list of “rests" it bought a smile to my face, as it highlighted how perfect The Zest Life retreats are at providing space to bring rest into our guests' lives. The mix of time to self, nature, yoga and meditation, and beach walks is like one enormous resting, reassuring hug.

<strong>So I ask: which type of rest resonates with you?</strong>

Could you aim to implement a restful practice every day? Maybe there could be a variety of restful practices in your week. Why not make your November more peaceful and instead of being drawn into the madness, use this month as an opportunity to rest and reset?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4143 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1203088907804590.vtSLanA8z9nZRTT7EcXH_height640.png" alt="beach-clean-week" width="286" height="300" />
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">I find his time of year to be such a contradiction. The season of Autumn shows us, quite literally, that it's alright to let go. Nature's energy starts to slow down and turn inward. So why is it then, that we look outwards with this idea of needing and wanting more? Halloween, Black Friday (week!) Christmas; all these events are designed to draw us towards feelings of lack and not being enough, so that we in turn spend more, buy more and do more. It’s those qualities that actually lead us to feel less than when we started and it culminates in us being on a never-ending quest in search of fulfilment. Nature is simple and steers her attention inward, so why don't we look to the simple things?</p>


Having just returned, in a haze of relaxation and bliss from our week of yoga and wild swimming in the Lake District, I couldn’t help but reflect on what it was that had turned me from an exhausted, frazzled being into this serenely, calm person. What were the aspects that were seamlessly sewn together to make this week so special?

<b>Nature</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We stayed in a house surrounded by majestic trees (so many trees!). It overlooked the tranquil lake, a stunning sunrise most mornings with mist gently rolling in on the water. There was an abundance of wildlife - pheasant, deer, mink, swans, rabbits. Everywhere you looked was either water, sky or greenery.</span>

<b>Yoga</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking that time out twice a day to land and to move in a way that made the body feel joyous.</span>

<b>Swim</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cold water swims without wetsuits, literally immersing oneself in nature. I ask, is there any greater way to feel mentally balanced and calm? </span>

<b>Connection</b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Laughter and friendly chatter with like-minded people from all walks of life.</span>

<b> Food </b>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lovingly prepared vegan food each and every day.</span>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">It's these simple qualities that we often overlook in our search for happiness. It wasn’t eating in fancy restaurants, wearing designer clothes or driving that fancy car that lead to this feeling of wholeness. I don't know about you, but what I find hard to comprehend is that all of the above is there for us to enjoy on a daily basis, so why is it so hard to tap into it?</p>
I know it is not easy to create these changes and I too look out there for validation. I catch myself saying “When I get this, then I will be happy. When I achieve that, then I will feel successful. When my children grow up and I have more time, then I will do more cooking!” But I fear those times will never come, as there is always something else that I am reaching for in the never-ending pursuit for peace of heart and quiet of mind.

This rainy Autumn evening, I had to take my son to Beavers and with an hour to fill I was very close to reaching for a Starbucks fix but thought I need to practise what I teach. So I drove to the beach with the girls, settled them at the water's edge, stripped off and threw myself in the sea for a float about in about 5 inches of water. The girls played while I splashed about like a beached whale, but still, I was in and all was well in those moments. Lying in the sea, looking at the girls laughing I knew I had made the right decision. Even though most of the time you might not be bothered, you never regret taking time out for yourself, time that is going to nourish your mind, body and heart.

So I ask you...What’s your connection to nature like? What’s your daily yoga practice, on or off the mat? How much connection do you have with like-minded, joyful people?

Do you ring fence time each day to walk or move your body so that it feels light and free? How much time do you put towards creating healthy meals that will nourish and provide you with the right energy? Take time to reflect on your answers.

Then try this month's medicine - a warm cup of tea, sitting quietly on a bench, basking in the low Autumn sunlight. You will be surprised at how blissful you start to feel. Creating big changes to our life physically, mentally and emotionally can sometimes feel overwhelming, so maybe start with one or two areas where you consciously dial down the busy and turn up the simple.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Benefits of giving up alcohol – and tips on how to do it</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4750 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TZL-October-2022-6.png" alt="giving-up-alcohol" width="300" height="300" /> With Macmillan’s annual <a href="https://www.gosober.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sober for October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign in full swing, more people than usual are teetotal at this time of year, so what better time to reflect on the benefits of not drinking alcohol?</span>

Taking the decision to stop drinking might seem like a huge lifestyle change, but with so many positives for the body and mind, is it something you should seriously consider?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that quitting alcohol will dramatically boost your physical and mental health and wellbeing. But if you enjoy the occasional glass of wine or beer, all is not lost.</span>



<span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most things in life, it’s about balance. Cutting back on alcohol can also have some major benefits, and there is a new movement known as ‘mindful drinking’. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few tips on how you can either stop drinking or drink more mindfully.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Tips on how to stop drinking</b></h2>
&nbsp;

<b>Aim for small victories</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t think about ‘never drinking again’ or giving up for a year, take one step at a time. Focus on the here and now. Depending on how often you drink now, aim to avoid alcohol that day, that weekend, or at that next social event.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Change how you socialise</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking alcohol is so ingrained in our culture, that you probably find that almost all of your social activities revolve around it. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Change the way you think about socialising and think of it as an opportunity to connect with others, rather than a reason to drink.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Reward yourself</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I find it’s much easier to stick to a goal if I know there’s a reward waiting for me when I hit a goal or milestone. It doesn’t have to be anything big, it could be something as simple as a new book or an after dinner treat.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Savour the clarity</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay attention to how you feel on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Rather than waking with a blurry or fuzzy head, enjoy the feeling of no dry mouth, no fatigue, no headache. This is why you’re cutting back, so savour it.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now you know how to go about cutting back, what health benefits can you expect to see?</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Benefits of quitting alcohol</b></h2>
<b>Reduced stress and anxiety</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people use alcohol to wind down, but it can often have the reverse effect. Alcohol affects the chemicals in our brains, causing them to be imbalanced, which can lead to higher levels of stress and anxiety.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Lower blood pressure</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Drinking alcohol makes the muscles in our blood vessels contract, potentially causing high blood pressure, and in turn, other long-term effects on the heart.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Healthier skin</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems logical that drinking alcohol would rehydrate you, but alcohol actually causes dehydration. This has a huge impact on your skin health, as your body takes water from your skin to compensate.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Better sleep quality</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it can feel like we fall asleep easier after having a drink or two, the quality of sleep is poorer. This can lead us to wake up in the morning tired, unmotivated, and groggy. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Weight loss</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugars from wine and cider, and barley from beer can cause unwanted weight gain, so cutting out alcohol is a really easy way to reduce your calorie intake without having to change what you eat.</span>

<title>The Importance of Repetition</title>
<link>https://keepmesnug.co.uk/the-importance-of-repetition/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true">https://keepmesnug.co.uk/the-importance-of-repetition/</guid>
<pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 09:36:17 +0000</pubDate>
<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4143 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WhatsApp-Image-2022-09-07-at-18.31.06.jpeg" alt="laura-blackberry-autumn" width="300" height="300" />

I heard a fascinating fact recently from a study on the happiness of a child’s upbringing. It concluded that one key element to a fulfilled and happy childhood was repetition.

Maybe it was pizza every Friday night, the holiday location you visited each Summer, or the same friends you met at school year on year. When you reflect on your childhood, were there times where you had repetition and if so, how does looking back on them make you feel?

Reflecting on that, I realised how privileged my upbringing was, in that it was filled with repetition.



I lived in the same house my whole life and next door to my grandparents, who I fondly remember gave us the same M&amp;S pavlova for pudding when ever they cooked us a roast meal, (it's funny how we remember the food). I went to the same school from 8 to 18 with the same friends, and we had the same caravan holiday every summer. Thinking about it, all of these elements must have created a deep feeling of stability and comfort for me as a child. I had nothing to fear and there was sense that all was well in the world.

Raising my children for the last three years in a split parent upbringing I have been very conscious of the effects this may have on their emotional stability. When I began my single parent life I was aware of creating routine and structure in each day. Those little anchors or repetitions of stability that help you through the troubled waters, getting you not only from day to day, but month to month and now year to year. Sunday morning pancakes, the same birthday traditions, visiting the grand-parents farm every weekend, the same park we play in after school. I can see now how these repetitions assist not only in the children's stability but mine too.

At this time of year, as the seasons shift and children go back to school feelings of being uprooted and unstable can rise, leaving us with this urge to feel grounded, like we need to fasten our seat belts and land. One chaotic day last week, this sense of quiet and comfort rose with in, it came out of nowhere on a day that was feeling otherwise overwhelming. I was simply picking blackberries. Enjoying a quiet moment out in nature and it was this feeling of “Yes, here we go again, September has arrived, the lovely long summer is drawing to a close, the children will soon be back to school and the the shift into Autumn has begun". I have found that when I observe the rhythms of nature they create natural repetitions (similar to the repetitions we mentioned about childhood), which in turn leads to a sense of comfort and security. Nature is forever giving; swallows arriving in the warmth of Spring, the blackberries following the heat of the Summer, the snowdrops peeping through the frosty ground in Winter.

Repetition is not just for childhood, its for adult life too. So as we move into September; this pivotal turning point in the year, where there are probably unsettling, physical shifts in routine, such as children heading back to schools, and of course the natural transition of the seasons, we can sometimes be thrown off guard. In response to this, I ask you to literally step into nature and notice and observe the repetition that is glorious Autumn. The closer you are to it the greater you feel its effects. Take comfort from the cool and fresh mornings, the leaves hanging silently on the trees waiting to drop, the hedgerows ripe with fruit, be in awe of natures repetitions that are there for us to feel connected and grounded, and this sense that I had in my childhood that there is nothing to fear and that all was well.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Wild Swimmers Fighting the War on Waste</title>

<category><![CDATA[Personal Growth]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4143 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Laura-TZL-Beach-Clean.png" alt="beach-clean-week" width="286" height="300" />

Wild swimming is an amazing experience.

The refreshing coolness of the water, the calmness of the surroundings, the breathtaking scenery… and an empty bottle of Coke.

Sadly, we are starting to see litter in our rivers, lakes, and seas more and more.

Between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes of plastic are tossed away into the sea every year.

And by 2040, this is expected to triple to over 26 million tonnes.



With litter already spoiling our beauty spots and damaging the environment, we need to act now to try and prevent the situation from worsening.

With both Recycle Week 2022 and the Great British Beach Clean happening this month, I thought it was the perfect time to highlight this problem with our readers - and share a few simple things you can do.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Take your litter home</strong></h2>
This is a huge problem at this time of year in north Wales.

While we love to see so many visitors enjoying our beautiful surroundings, the litter left behind at Llyn Padarn at the end of a sunny day is incredibly upsetting.

Please be responsible and take EVERYTHING you bring to a wild swim spot, back home with you.

A lack of public bins (or full ones) is no excuse to leave litter behind. It’s easy enough to take a small container with you, so you can dispose of your rubbish at home.

If you want to go one step further, you could also pick up rubbish left behind by others.

I know it’s a big ask, but with the <a href="https://www.mcsuk.org/what-you-can-do/join-a-beach-clean/great-british-beach-clean/">Great British Beach Clean</a> happening 16th-25th September, it’s the perfect opportunity to do that little bit extra. Last year, 385 pieces of litter were found per 100m of beach!

<strong> </strong>
<h2><strong>Recycle more</strong></h2>
The raw materials we use to create things like plastic, paper, and glass are in limited supply. By recycling the materials we’ve already harvested, mined, or created, the less we need to extract in the future.

While protecting natural resources is a hugely important reason to recycle, we should also consider the damage extracting these resources can do to forests and animal habitats.

We use less energy when making products from recycled materials too. For example, creating aluminium foil from recycled cans uses 95% less energy than when making it from raw materials.

As a result of all this, recycling also helps us cut carbon emissions.

&nbsp;
<h2><strong>Reduce the amount of plastic you use </strong></h2>
It’s not just recycling plastic that’s key to protecting our wildlife and environment, it’s actually cutting the amount of plastic we use, particularly single-use plastic.

It’s not biodegradable, so when it is left behind on picnic benches, in the park, or wherever else, it doesn’t rot and often ends up in our natural waters.

Consider swapping your usual shop-bought bottle of water for a reusable one and refilling on the go, or preparing your lunch at home instead of buying individually wrapped items. This is one of the reasons we bring our soups in flasks and sandwiches in paper bags for our retreat guests to enjoy post-swim.

Please consider what you can do to keep your wild swimming spots clean and safe for generations to enjoy in the future.

&nbsp;

<strong>Our final wild swimming retreats of the year are happening this month, and there are only a few spaces left, so <a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/best-yoga-retreats-uk/swim-the-lakes-yoga-and-wild-swimming-retreat-5-day/">click here</a> if you'd like to join us for a last-minute break in the Lake District.</strong>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's no doubting the summer holidays can be a stressful time of year. That dream beach or peaceful mountain retreat sounds great on paper but the hassle of getting there can try the patience of even the most patient. The traffic jams to the airport, the queues to check-in, having to go through onerous security - and you have to do it all again at the other end. So much standing around waiting for the next stage of the process means your body goes into hibernation almost leaving you feeling slow and lethargic. Being able to disconnect from your surroundings, even for a few moments, can do wonders for stress levels as a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5yzVvcPpdDXm2LC3NHD2rpf/what-s-the-best-way-to-beat-stress">BBC TV show called Trust Me, I'm a Doctor</a> found out and perhaps the whole travel scenario is just one reason why more and more people are seeing the benefits of yoga.

As we examined <a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/yoga-boost-immunity/%23more-689">in our piece ‘Yoga To Boost Immunity’</a>, keeping our bodies active plays an essential role in our defences against diseases and helps keep our immune systems strong where even basic neck exercises can keep the lymph flowing from our head to our body and avoiding a build up within our necks.

Another benefit from doing yoga on a regular basis is the effect it can have on one's mental health.

Indeed, it's not just the celebrities we often find in glossy gossip magazines who have taken to yoga - even the world of football has embraced the concept. Traditionally a footballer would have his life mapped out with training and playing with a couple of vices thrown in to keep the testosterones pumping but elite sports people are much more aware of their bodies and their mental health these days than even a few years back and go that extra mile to take care of themselves.

&nbsp;

<strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>

<figure><a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cristiano_Ronaldo_2018.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4699" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cristiano_Ronaldo_2018-300x300.jpg" alt="cristiano-ronaldo-yoga" width="300" height="300" /></a> CREDIT Анна Нэсси, Cristiano Ronaldo 2018, CC BY-SA 3.0</figure>

We'll start with one player the younger, tech-savvy generation call the GOAT! Portuguese international Ronaldo has won more than 30 trophies in a glittering career and scored over 800 goals for club and country. In 2009 he left Manchester United to join Real Madrid for what was then a world record transfer fee of £80 million. He may be 37 years old now but a look at his Instagram account, which has 451 million followers, will show you a man who prioritises keeping in shape and yoga, along with daily meditation, has played its part in keeping his remarkable career going.

&nbsp;

<strong>Per Mertsesacker</strong>

<figure><a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/599px-54_Merci_Arsene_-_Per_Mertesacker_27086040527.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4698" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/599px-54_Merci_Arsene_-_Per_Mertesacker_27086040527-300x300.jpg" alt="per-mertesacker-yoga" width="300" height="300" /></a> CREDIT Ronnie Macdonald from Chelmsford and Largs, United Kingdom, 54 Merci Arsène - Per Mertesacker (27086040527), CC BY 2.0</figure>

Per Mertesacker won over 100 caps for the German national team winning the World Cup in 2014. An ungainly 6' 6'' in his stocking feet, Mertesacker was an assured defender who thought deeply about the game and is now using his experience to head up the academy at Arsenal where he ended his playing career. He has described how coming down from the high of winning the World Cup in Brazil was difficult to deal with so he turned to yoga.

<em>“When you are superstitious – which most footballers are – you need to have your habits every week. The benefits are physical and mental, to strengthen my body, to stretch my body, and mentally to relax and calm down.''</em>

&nbsp;

<strong>Lionel Messi</strong>

<figure><a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Lionel_Messi_20180626.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4701" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Lionel_Messi_20180626-300x300.jpg" alt="lionel-messi-yoga" width="300" height="300" /></a> CREDIT Кирилл Венедиктов, Lionel Messi 20180626, CC BY-SA 3.0</figure>

The mercurial Argentinian striker Lionel Messi is another who draws strength from his yoga and meditation. The 10-time La Liga winner with Barcelona has also won the UEFA Champions League on four occasions and it was this serial winner mentality that encouraged French giants Paris Saint-Germain to sign him at the beginning of the 2021/22 season. The Parisians are among the favourites for the trophy this season in <a href="https://sports.coral.co.uk/sport/football/matches/today">Coral’s latest football odds</a> and if they were to win it, assisted by Messi, it would be a prestigious first European success for them. The 35-year-old striker, like Ronaldo, is almost obsessive about staying fit and healthy and during the 2014 World Cup he followed a power yoga programme designed by an American yogi to keep his mind fresh. His French side will be hoping it is this attention to detail that will help them in their quest for European success.

&nbsp;

<strong>David Silva</strong>

<figure><a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/David_Silva_Euro_2012_vs_France_01.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4700" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/David_Silva_Euro_2012_vs_France_01-300x300.jpg" alt="david-silva-yoga" width="300" height="300" /></a> CREDIT Football.ua, David Silva Euro 2012 vs France 01, CC BY-SA 3.0</figure>

After 12 trophy laden years with Manchester City and Spain, David Silva continues to hit the heights with his present club Real Sociedad. As part of the legendary Spanish side from the early years of the 21st century, Silva won the UEFA European Championship twice in 2008 and 2012, throwing in the World Cup in 2010 for good measure. Moving to City he added four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and five EFL Cups to his trophy cabinet. Yet, ironically, it was a player from City's cross town rivals, Manchester United who gave Silva the yoga bug.

<em>''With so many games you have to play non-stop and anything you can find which helps you prepare for these games is good. I have taken up yoga with the same teacher as Ryan (Giggs). It’s been another way of helping me stretch out after games. It’s helped me get back in shape.''</em>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We have come a long since yoga and meditation were linked to the 1960s and counter-culture. It has been mainstream for a good many years with the world famous <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-benefits-of-yoga">Johns Hopkins Hospital promoting its benefits</a> and with so many elite sports people practicing it in one form or another there are plenty of positive role models out there to look up to.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4143 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/WhatsApp-Image-2022-08-01-at-9.33.22-AM.jpeg" width="300" height="300" />

In today's society I feel there is a huge pressure to be perfect, and not just perfect at one thing, but perfect in every aspect of life. Even if your life isn’t flawless there is this idea that one has to portray the fact that it is.

When you get asked the question “How are you?”, how often do you reply with an “I’m fine, life is great”, when inside you are feeling overwhelmed and that things might not be as bright as you would like. Do we respond in that way for fear of how people might react to our slightly less than positive, perfect response?



Over the summer months that pressure seems to get even greater. That pressure to create the most wonderful summer and give the children the most memorable holidays, with the perfect mix of activity and down time is exhausting. But the more the pressure builds the more I struggle with my energy levels being spread so thinly and that feeling of not doing anything as well as I’d like!

But in those moments I ask myself does it really matter if my children don't clean their teeth one night, or my yoga practice ends up being 10 minutes instead of one hour, or that I don’t get round to making the healthy plant-based recipe I pulled out from the supplements for the 9th weekend on the run? Let’s not even mention the evening mediation practice that has gone out the window ever since the children have decided that in the summer months their bedtime is now 10pm!

There is a massive feeling of guilt that surrounds the roles that I play in life; as mother, friend, daughter, sister, neighbour, boss, colleague or teacher. But I hope you can agree that we cannot do it all. It’s impossible to give all areas of life 100% enthusiasm all of the time and actually wouldn’t we be better off allowing ourselves to take rest and not feel guilty about doing so? All that really matters surely is that we do our best, with the energy and resources that we have in that moment on that day. As the Scouts say DYB, DYB, DYB, do your best, not be your best, but do your best.

So the next time you notice that you are struggling, pause and know that you are not alone and remember we are all muddling along through this miracle we call life, it's not an easy ride but it's the best one we shall ever have.

Take a deep breath, hold your head high, and don't forget as Glennon Doyle author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Untamed-Glennon-Doyle/dp/1984801252">Untamed</a> says "we can do hard things".]]></content:encoded>

Wild swimming is one of the most freeing experiences you can do. Not only is it a great workout, but it’s easy to allow yourself to just be absorbed by the nature surrounding you, clearing your mind of the hustle of everyday life.

However, wild swimming can set alarm bells off for many people. You may have questions about what happens when you go, or how you might feel.

Here are some FAQs I get from people either new to wild swimming or people who have never tried it.


<h2>Why is wild swimming good for you?</h2>
Wild swimming is an instant mood booster helping to alleviate depression, you get such a rush of all the feel good hormones. It jump starts your metabolism too so you burn calories and it’s a full body workout. The cold water stimulates your lymphatic system which promotes a better immune system. The ecotherapy element of swimming, immersing yourself in nature, helps you to slow down, destress and feel gratitude for the wonderful world we live in.
<h2>What happens to the body when emerged in cold water?</h2>
The first thing that would happen would be your body's shock response to the cold; gasping, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing. These all occur due to the reflex response of the cold water on your skin. After skin cooling, the next layer to cool down is your nerves and muscles. This impairs their function, nerve impulses are slowed and muscles stiffen. Arms cool down quickest due to them being smaller than your legs, often people have uncontrollable splaying of the hands and swimming movements can be severely restricted.
This can be prevented though! The important thing is to stay calm and control your breathing. Deep breaths in and out through the nose can help keep you calm and allow your body to get over the initial cold shock.
<h2>How would you describe the experience of swimming in nature?</h2>
Wild swimming is literally a complete immersion into nature. When you are out there no one can reach you, there is no tech, no one calling and you feel completely removed from the fast paced world we live in. It's time to slow down and unwind.
<h2>How does swimming with a group improve / change the experience?</h2>
Swimming with a group is obviously safer. Having others around you allows you to relax into the experience as you know there is someone watching out for you. There is often positive encouragement from other swimmers helping you to stay in longer or swim further. There is also an accountability when swimming with others, so you are more likely to stay committed to going and the habit strengthens.
<h2>What advice would you give to someone wild swimming for the first time?</h2>
Start in the summer when the water temperature is higher. Go with a friend or a guide to give you the encouragement you need. There are many wild swimming guides out there offering day excursions and retreats. Take an inflatable swimming tow float for reassurance and safety.
<h2>What effects on health and happiness can regular wild swimming have? What have you seen in others/experienced yourself?</h2>
What I love is that you don't need to be in the water for hours, it's such a quick fix. You can be having the most stressful day and a two minute cold water dip washes it all away. It’s also complete escapism, it is one of the greatest and most easily accessible ways to feel completely alive and it’s free!

Lemon juice / zest

Salt &amp; pepper

A good glug of Pesto (we've been using homemade wild garlic pesto that Catherine made earlier in the year and froze)

So, this month sees the celebration of Simplicity Day. Theirs seems to be a day for everything these days but this is one that really struck a chord with me.

Since the lockdown when everything was much simpler, life has sped up. I don’t know about you but it almost feels like it is back to how it was pre pandemic. It's hard to remember what it was like all those months ago when we had to go so slow and we actually had time to stop smell the roses as they say.

&nbsp;



I am all for the simple pleasure in life. You know me, I love the outdoors and simply being in nature with the family is heaven, but sometimes I do resort to tech with the children. More often than I would like, if I am to be honest. It buys me time; time to make tea, send an email or just have five minutes where I am not being mauled.
<p data-redactor-style-cache="text-align: center;">Anyway, last week my son broke our TV. He threw the remote at the screen in a moment of impatience (no judgement please) and the screen is now cracked. He knows it was a silly decision and we are now living with the consequences where no one has any TV time (myself included!). That evening all four us sat on the sofa, with this empty space before bedtime that would normally be filled with some annoying show that they love. “What do we do now? I said."</p>
Freddie's response was along these lines “It's like being in the olden times, let's play”. And play we did and haven’t stopped since then. It's been a week now with no TV. Yes there are moments when it's all a bit fraught and I go to turn it on but then I realise the situation and say “Go play, find something fun to do”. I turn around and five minutes later the sitting room looks like a bomb has gone off, but an elaborate den has been built and there is laughter. What can I say to that? We’ve had the Lego out more times than I can count and yes it's more mess but actually, secretly, I am enjoying not having it on. Those horrendous Netflix programs they would end up watching are no more, for now at least. Come winter, it might be a different story.

And what about me? Well of an evening I am pottering in the garden, doing a bit more work, practising yoga, phoning friends, reading and going to bed earlier. So all in all, it's a win win. Thank you Freddie for showing us that we can find ways to be with out tech in every part of our lives. So this month we as a family are very much embracing the simple pleasures in our household. Why not join me and try a week of no TV? Embrace the simplicity of simply being human and enjoying each others company with play, fun and laughter and of course a bit of mess!

Wild swimming is the most wonderful experience. There is something invigorating about feeling the cold, natural waters of rivers, lakes, and seas against your skin.

As well as providing an immediate sense of relaxation, it also has many benefits, such as soothing aching muscles, releasing endorphins, and relieving stress. If you keep at it, your body starts to adapt to the cold and at this point, cold water immersion is clinically proven to relieve depression, boost your immune system, tone your muscles, and even increase your libido.

While I love the sense of freedom wild swimming provides, it's important to remember that it can be dangerous. So, here are my top 10 tips for staying safe in the water this summer.

&nbsp;


<h2>1. Check the water quality</h2>
Have a good look at the water before diving in - is it clean and clear? You want it to be free of blue-green algae and scum. Avoid urban rivers, stagnant lakes, and canals as these are more likely to contain harmful bacteria.

&nbsp;
<h2>2. Have an exit point</h2>
Check that when you enter the water you can exit safely, and if not there, then have a point in mind to aim for to exit. It's really important that you do this <em>before</em> getting in, as if something does go wrong and you end up panicking, it becomes harder to think clearly.

&nbsp;
<h2>3. No swimming alone</h2>
It is always best to swim with someone else, whether that's a friend, other like-minded people at the water, or as part of a guided swim. Not only is it safer to have other people around to help should the worst happen, but it's often more enjoyable too.

&nbsp;
<h2>4. Avoid other water users</h2>
Keep an eye out for other traffic in the water. Jet skis and motor boats can be dangerous and are unpleasant to swim around. Try to time your swim so that it is at a quieter time of day our move to a different part of the lake, sea or further down stream a river for a quieter location.

&nbsp;
<h2>5. Have the right gear</h2>
Being visible in the water is key for safety. Make sure you have a bright coloured swim hat or tow float so you are easily seen. The tow float will be essential for your safety should you get into difficulty. Neoprene gloves and boots might be an idea too if you feel the cold and wish to stay in the water longer.

&nbsp;
<h2>6. Have a plan (and pack) for warming up</h2>
Know that when you come out of the water you core body temperature will have probably dropped quite a bit, so have all you clothes laid out ready, with towel and coat to hand. A thermos with a hot drink at the ready is perfect too. My favourite is warm Ribena - that bit of sweetness is the perfect pick me up after a cold swim.

&nbsp;
<h2>7. Don’t panic</h2>
Sometimes the cold water can be unsettling, so it's really important to stay calm and focus on your breathing if you do feel distressed. Relax, count your breaths, inhale 1, exhale 2…. Hold onto you tow float if need be whilst you acclimatise and tread water for a bit whilst you get your breath back and your mind calm.

&nbsp;
<h2>8. Don't drive straight away</h2>
Take five minutes at least to get warm. You need to know that you are 100% before you drive. You hands and feet might feel numb and you might not coordinated, so take as much time as you need. More time for tea drinking!

&nbsp;
<h2>9. Understand the water</h2>
The UK has a host of amazing places to swim but m are sure you understand the depth, speed and type of water you are entering before swimming. Slowly wading in is always a great idea. Never dive you never know what lies beneath.

&nbsp;
<h2>10. Know your limits</h2>
Start with short swims, there are no prizes for staying in the water till your toes fall off! There is a lot of science behind the benefits of the cold water but gradually build up to longer periods in the water. A couple of minutes may well be enough to start. Never put yourself in dangerous situation because of something you have been told or read.

&nbsp;

Most importantly enjoy yourself, remember you are doing this for fun!

 	<li>Turn off heat and add frozen peas and chopped fresh herbs - I like to use a small handful of each of those listed above but you can just use mint if you prefer.</li>
 	<li>Once peas have defrosted and you can stir everything up in the pan easily, blitz the mixture until really smooth</li>
 	<li>Once you've got it silky smooth, you can add the milk and/or cream until you reach your desired consistency. I like this soup to be reasonably thin as it feels more summery this way.. we have plenty of wintery days for thick &amp; chunky soups!</li>
 	<li>Squeeze in your lemon before serving - along with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


The trick to keeping this soup a beautiful vibrant green colour is to not boil it for too long.

The peas will be fine just dunked into the hot stock mix and the soup will taste more zingy if you add your fresh herbs right before blending!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we look forward to the Jubilee celebrations this weekend, I began to think just how wonderful the Queen is for her age and wouldn’t it be wonderful to have her round for a cup of tea and a chat!

I believe listening to our elders is an opportunity to learn; all the wisdom, the skills and the stories that get passed on, that's learning like it used to be, where knowledge was passed from generation to generation.

I really do enjoy the company of elders and one in particular. Let me introduce you to my 80 year old, widowed neighbour, Bryan.

<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4143" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-31-at-4.30.36-PM-225x300.jpeg" alt="bryan-and-laura" width="225" height="300" />He was married for 52 years and I only really started talking to Bryan when I became single a few years after his wife died.

We used to say “hello” and the usual pleasantries, then one day we chatted a bit longer over the wall between us. To be honest I was probably just putting off going into the house to face the squealing children, but it sparked a little connection between us.

Anyway, the little “hellos" continued and when December arrived I had some spare advent calendars which I gave to Bryan to give to the children.

&nbsp;

Every day after school they would want to go and see Bryan, have a chat and most importantly have a chocolate. The children would muck about, interested in all or Bryan's trinkets, and Bryan and I would have a bit of a natter about nothing and everything.

As the winter progressed we'd come back after school, cold from the park and I'd say to the children “go and see Bryan and get warm” (he always has his heating on full blast). I’d then fall into my house, laden with bags and buggy, light the fire, get the pasta on and I'd come back with a cup of tea and the timer. When the timer for supper went we said our goodbyes and went home.

By the time we had trotted back, the children had thawed out, Bryan had had has some cheerful company, our supper would be ready and our fire would be roaring.

Needless to say, we as a family now spend a lot of time with Bryan.

When I feel challenged by modern day life he brings me down a peg or two. I start complaining about the size of my house with the three children, he politely reminds me how he and his wife raised their four children (one of whom died in a car crash at 19) in a house the same size as mine with only a back yard in which they loved to play.

He talks of his family trips to the coast; taking his work van and putting their sofa in the back for his children to sit on! How they would meet other families and have marvellous feasts on the beach; Bryn always making the best fried onions of course! He recounts these tales time and time again. I don't mind listening, as I know it brings him joy to reminisce about the past.

He doesn’t talk about the flash car he drove or the amount of money he earned. He talks of all the happy times; the mischievous experiences he had in his youth with friends, the the dinners he loved to cook for his family, the three jobs he worked to pay his way, the holidays he took with his wife later in life to countries like Greece and Turkey which were so exotic to him. I wonder as you enter the winter of your life, when your future looks short and unknown, do you begin to simply look back to the life that you have lived? One hopes that you are one of the lucky ones to look back and smile.

I take such comfort from Bryans company.

I think it is the fact that he is no longer proving, or performing, or perfecting his life like most of us our today. He has suffered great sadness in his life but he lives to tell the tale and even though his life appears very small now, he struggles to walk far and doesn’t leave the house often, he has contentment and peace in his life.

How I wish I could feel that.

I wonder does that contentment only come with age or can we learn it young? He has no idea how much he gives me by simply being there, day in day out, without judgement and always a smile. My grandparents are long gone, so to have Bryan is such a joy. The stability I feel of knowing that he’s looking out for me and my children is priceless. He gives the gift of time. I ask is there a greater gift?

Often it takes a celebration like this weekend to make time in our busy lives to get together with family and friends. High days can encourage us to take stock and think about what's important, but should it really take the queen being on the thrown for 70 years to make us prioritise experiences with family, friends, or even neighbours?

I say let’s not wait till we are 80 to realise that these simple every day interactions and experiences are what make up our lives, it's not the standing at the alter or holding your baby for the first time, they are just big events that get thrown in along the way, it's the everyday “hello" to neighbours that makes the world go round. So let's see if we can find a little jubilee celebration in every day and start saying “hello”.

<h1>Top 5 Spots for Wild Swimming in Wales</h1>
<h1>

It wasn’t until I started cold water swimming in April 2014 that I began to realise how lucky I was to live in a part of the world that had so many amazing wild swimming locations.

Lakes, coast, and waterfalls, you name it - north Wales has it.

So, whether you love the freedom of the salty open seas or the clear waters of lakes with majestic mountain backdrops, you’ll find one you love amongst my favourite wild swimming locations.

&nbsp;
<h2></h2>
<h2>Laura’s top five wild swimming spots in Wales</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3>5. Llyn Idwal, Snowdonia</h3>
<a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4292 size-full" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1.png" alt="Llyn-Idwal-Snowdonia" width="940" height="788" /></a>

In the oldest National Nature Reserve in Wales, you will find a bowl-shaped hollow filled with crystal clear waters.

The walk up and around is a three mile loop, but once you have climbed the stepped path up, you will not be disappointed.

The site is world famous for its rock formations and its rare and fragile plant life, so please do take care and leave nothing but your footprints and take nothing but photographs.

<em>Top tip: All year round the water is freezing.</em>
<h3></h3>
&nbsp;
<h3>4. Porth Ceriad, Llyn Peninsula</h3>
<a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Top-5-wild-swimming-locations.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4300" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Top-5-wild-swimming-locations.png" alt="porth-ceriad-llyn-peninsula" width="940" height="788" /></a>
A stunning often deserted beach down a rocky cliff face.

As you come over the headland you see the expanse of beach before you, often waves rolling in when the wind is onshore.

Steep steps lead you down to the beach, enjoy a walk along then take a dip.

There are no facilities here.

<em>Top tip: First thing in the morning it is often deserted.</em>

&nbsp;
<h3>3. Newborough Beach, Anglesey</h3>
<a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4293" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2.png" alt="newborough-beach-anglesey" width="940" height="788" /></a>

Beautiful stretch of beach across the west coast of Anglesey, looking across to Snowdonia, and backed by dunes and woodland. Plenty of parking,

If you go when the tide is out, you can walk along the beach to Llanddwyn Island, walk as far as the lighthouse and discover the coves and hidden beaches.

Our guests love it here and are blown away by the panoramic views

<em>Top tip: Walk out to the lighthouse to discover the coves and hidden beaches.</em>

&nbsp;
<h3>2. Llyn Padarn, Snowdonia</h3>
<a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4294" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3.png" alt="llyn-padarn-snowdonia" width="940" height="788" /></a>

Nestled beneath Mount Snowdon, it is one of the most photographed lakes in Snowdonia.

There are many ways to enter the cool waters of Padarn, but take care as the slate rocks can be quite sharp.

The lagoons offer a sheltered stretch of water for beginners, and on the far side from the lagoons you can walk to large rocks that jut out into the lake, and jump in off them. The water is so clear you see all the rocks and slate beneath.

The length of the lake is 3.2km, a great challenge might be to swim the length or take the mini train to one end and swim back.

<em>Top tip: Avoid bank holidays, it gets very busy.</em>

&nbsp;
<h3>1. Plas Cadnant, Anglesey</h3>
<a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Top-5-wild-swimming-locations-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4299" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Top-5-wild-swimming-locations-1.png" alt="plas-cadnant-waterfall" width="940" height="788" /></a>

Walk down through the hidden gardens of Plas Cadnant, listen for the water and follow the sound.

Amongst the ancient trees you will see a beautiful waterfall flowing into a plunge pool. It's big enough to do laps should you wish or lie back and float with the afternoon sun beaming down through the trees on your face.

<em>Top tip: Step across the red jasper rocks and plunge in!</em>]]></content:encoded>

Join us on a <a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/best-yoga-retreats-uk/yoga-and-wild-swimming-retreat-4-day/">yoga and wild swimming retreat</a> and we will take you to these spectacular locations. Choose from the freedom of the salty open seas or the clear waters of lakes with majestic mountain backdrops. We tailor the swims to each group, depending on abilities and what you fancy getting up to!

As we look forward to the Jubilee celebrations this weekend, I began to think just how wonderful the Queen is for her age and wouldn’t it be wonderful to have her round for a cup of tea and a chat!

I believe listening to our elders is an opportunity to learn; all the wisdom, the skills and the stories that get passed on, that's learning like it used to be, where knowledge was passed from generation to generation.

I really do enjoy the company of elders and one in particular. Let me introduce you to my 80 year old, widowed neighbour, Bryan.

<img class="border alignleft wp-image-4143" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-31-at-4.30.36-PM-225x300.jpeg" alt="bryan-and-laura" width="225" height="300" />He was married for 52 years and I only really started talking to Bryan when I became single a few years after his wife died.

We used to say “hello” and the usual pleasantries, then one day we chatted a bit longer over the wall between us. To be honest I was probably just putting off going into the house to face the squealing children, but it sparked a little connection between us.

Anyway, the little “hellos" continued and when December arrived I had some spare advent calendars which I gave to Bryan to give to the children.

&nbsp;

Every day after school they would want to go and see Bryan, have a chat and most importantly have a chocolate. The children would muck about, interested in all or Bryan's trinkets, and Bryan and I would have a bit of a natter about nothing and everything.

As the winter progressed we'd come back after school, cold from the park and I'd say to the children “go and see Bryan and get warm” (he always has his heating on full blast). I’d then fall into my house, laden with bags and buggy, light the fire, get the pasta on and I'd come back with a cup of tea and the timer. When the timer for supper went we said our goodbyes and went home.

By the time we had trotted back, the children had thawed out, Bryan had had has some cheerful company, our supper would be ready and our fire would be roaring.

He doesn’t talk about the flash car he drove or the amount of money he earned. He talks of all the happy times; the mischievous experiences he had in his youth with friends, the the dinners he loved to cook for his family, the three jobs he worked to pay his way, the holidays he took with his wife later in life to countries like Greece and Turkey which were so exotic to him. I wonder as you enter the winter of your life, when your future looks short and unknown, do you begin to simply look back to the life that you have lived? One hopes that you are one of the lucky ones to look back and smile.

I take such comfort from Bryans company.

I think it is the fact that he is no longer proving, or performing, or perfecting his life like most of us our today. He has suffered great sadness in his life but he lives to tell the tale and even though his life appears very small now, he struggles to walk far and doesn’t leave the house often, he has contentment and peace in his life.

As millions of families and friends will be coming together this bank holiday weekend to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, we thought it would be wonderful to share this easy summer salad with you, so you can recreate it at home.



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

2 vine tomatoes
1 red onion
1/2 a cucumber
Handful of radishes
Chilli flakes
A drizzle of olive oil

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the dressing</span>
250g Greek yogurt (dairy or plant based)
Fresh dill, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
Juice from 1/2 a lemon

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Chop the tomatoes and cucumber so they're still nice and chunky</li>
 	<li>Slice onion and radishes into thin rounds</li>
 	<li>Set aside</li>
 	<li>For your base, mix the yogurt with crushed garlic, chopped dill, and lemon juice</li>
 	<li>Spread the base over a plate and top with your chopped veggies, a drizzle of oil, and a sprinkle of chilli flakes</li>
</ol>


&nbsp;

As this is an assembly of fresh ingredients (no cooking required!), it’s perfect for BBQs. buffets, street and garden parties.

Your selection of ingredients is key here - the tomatoes should be firm and sweet; the cucumber should have that summer green smell; and the radishes still full of crunch.

Made with love and care, a summer salad like this is an absolute joy!

</p>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

½ cup nut butter of your choice

¾ cup oats

½ tbsp cacao powder

¼ cup desiccated coconut

¼ cup honey, agave or maple syrup

½ tsp vanilla essence

2 tbsp flaked almonds, toasted

2 tbsp mini dark chocolate chips/raisins / chopped hazelnuts

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Start by gently toasting the almonds &amp; coconut in a dry pan over medium heat – this will only take 30-60 seconds so keep an eye on your pan! Remove from heat as soon as you get the tiniest hint of golden colour.

2. Add all other ingredients into your mixing bowl in the order listed and give it all a good mix.

3. Check whether the mixture holds together nicely (you want to be able to form a ball in the palm of your hands without getting too sticky). If it’s too dry and crumbly, add a little more nut butter. If it feels too soggy, add a few more oats.

4. Roll the mixture into bite-size balls and leave to chill in the fridge or freezer so they firm up before you eat them.



The great thing about making energy balls is that you can play around with the ingredients and find flavour combinations you like. Just explore what you have in your cupboard once you’ve got the starter mix of nut butter and oats (try using seeds, any chopped nuts, chopped dried fruits, or a teaspoon of cinnamon or ground ginger instead of the cacao powder)

Once made, they will keep in the fridge for a week (store in a plastic tub) or you can freeze them and just take them out when you want them.

Step 1 - Sift together flour, baking powder, spices into a bowl and then mix in sugar
Step 2 -In a separate bowl, mash bananas and then add in milk, oil and vanilla
Step 3 - Stir wet ingredients into dry - just until it's all combined
Step 4 - Pour into a greased tin and bake for 30-40 mins @180 (or until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean)

To make this into a special occasion cake, make a simple frosting by beating 1/2 cup plant based butter (we love Naturli but the Flora block is fine and widely available), 2 cups icing sugar. 1.5 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp plant based milk together. Bake cake in 2 sandwich tins and spread icing in between the layers and on top of your cake. Then of course, enjoy!

<div class="" dir="auto" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 280px;">

All I ever wanted was to be a mother. I was 34 when I had my first child and now I have three beautiful children, Freddie, Beatrice and Florence. Raising them and staying sane is the hardest thing I have ever done and will probably ever do in my life.

To be honest, up until I had children all I ever really thought about was myself. I would spend hours a day practising yoga, gosh it was so indulgent! I would clean and hoover before my practice, as the right environment had to be created, incense, music etc. Oh, how times have changed, as I roll out my mat brushing aside the crisps and crumbs from beneath it! But during those years I remember going to an Ashtanga yoga workshop, learning about the discipline of a daily practice. 

In Ashtanga yoga, you are meant to practise two hours a day six days a week! I questioned this with regards to when you have children and those 6 am yoga slots are just not available anymore. The teacher's response was along the lines of “As long as the intention is there that's all that matters. It's when you stop rolling out the mat that you have a problem.” He said "You roll out the mat, wherever you are and your practice might be standing at the top of the mat taking five deep breaths, or you might just be getting into your flow and you are needed elsewhere to deal with demands of your children. But no matter how long or how deeply you practise the intention is there". I have thought about this a lot over the last six years and take great comfort from this. 


I can be very hard on myself at times, as I am sure we all can. The self talk that I am not doing enough yoga, exercise or whatever can often be so loud, but at the end of the day, I try to remember that there is only so much energy to go around and that children take up a huge amount of that!


So yes, life has become very hectic since becoming a mother to my three children who are now 5, 3 and 2. If only I had a pound for every time someone said, “Gosh you’ve got your hands full” as I fly past like some mad woman leading a travelling circus. It is so very hard at times and can sometimes be overwhelmingly stressful. Even as I write this at 6.30am I have my youngest awake and I can hear her pouring water from cups, it's bought me ten minutes to write this but it will involve ten minutes of clearing up! It is relentless, which is why holding on to regular yoga practice has been so vital to my health and helps to create a pillar of wellness for me.

Dr Julie Smith’s book "Why has no one told me this before?" talks about building resilience to the stress of life whether it's motherhood or not. She describes the importance of working on your defence players. These players in your game of life are what will help you cope with the curve balls that motherhood throws at you. They are all the small, simple actions and choices you take on a daily basis to protect yourself from basically losing your sh*t and falling down that slippery slope into low mood and depression. Food, sleep, time to self, good relationships, exercise, time outdoors, etc. They don't offer huge instant rewards but over time, put together, they are what protect you and keep you afloat. I feel with motherhood, it is vital to keep your defence up. Some of these areas become shattered in an instant, like your sleep, for example, you have no say over that with newborn babies, or even five year olds for that matter, crawling into your bed in the middle of the night. Other areas become eroded over time, like your diet. That feeling when there doesn’t seem enough time to make a meal for yourself and your dinner ends up being you eating humous straight from the tub. But for me my biggest defence player is exercise and exercise outdoors is even better. It has always been and always will be a non negotiable defence player. I have always kept up my exercise, even after a sleepless night, weary and bruised to the bone. I still get up and I move my body, there is no other decision to be made. Whether it was a run outside in the sun pushing the buggy, or grabbing a quick yoga flow whilst the baby napped and now, being able to drop them all off at school and nursery, I am able to enjoy some great gym sessions as a kick start to my day, which in turn has a positive impact on my mental wellbeing and hence my ability to mother in a calm and patient way.

Having said that, motivation and creating habits are tricky things to establish. You aren’t born with motivation. You have to start something and once you get into the flow that is when the motivation comes and that is when the habit starts to stick. I have always been a lover of routine so for me, an easy way of creating a habit that I want to maintain is to stack the habit onto a task that I already do daily. During the lockdowns when no one was doing anything in the evenings I really started to develop my meditation practice. I piggybacked my mediation practice to the end of the childrens' bedtime ritual and in doing so it has meant that the meditation nearly always happens. My children’s bedtime is roughly the same every night and before I take them up, I roll out my mat, (in front of the fire in winter or out in the garden in summer) and once they all are asleep and before I do anything else; make a snack or check emails, I get on my mat. Sometimes falling face down with complete exhaustion, sometimes quietly sitting for ten minutes before drifting into sleep, and other times I am more alert and half an hour simply flies by. But either way, I come to my mat, resting within myself, with gratitude for this small window in my day where it's just my mat, my body and my breath.

I believe we all mother in one way or another; putting other people first, caring about friends, or looking after older relatives, in my eyes that's all mothering. So to all you amazing mothers out there, and I don't just mean those of you who have children. Make sure you practise self-care and look after yourself, it is not being selfish. I have realised that no one else can do the self care work for you, you have to be the one to put in the hours and the energy into your own wellbeing. And if no one is walking through your day at the end of the day to make you a cup of tea or simply ask about your day, remember you have the resilience to do and be the most amazing person. You have got this! Happy Mothers Day EVERYONE!

Dedicated to the three loves of my life, Freddie, Beatrice and Florence.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1 bunch kale (about 5 oz)</span></li>
 	<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled</span></li>
 	<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1 Granny smith apple (or any large apple)</span></li>
 	<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">5 celery stalks, ends trimmed</span></li>
 	<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">½ large English cucumber</span></li>
 	<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Handful fresh parsley (about 1 oz)</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<strong>Method:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li id="instruction-step-1">Wash and prep the vegetables. (Depending on what kind of juicer you have, you'll want to cut the veggies to a size that fits well in the feeder or blender)</li>
 	<li id="instruction-step-2">Juice in the order listed (or add them to a blender and blend on high.)</li>
 	<li id="instruction-step-3">If you used a juicer, simply pour the green juice into glasses and enjoy immediately. If you used a blender, the juice will be thicker. If you don't enjoy pulp in your juice, use a small mesh sieve to pour the juice through, and use the back of a spoon to press the pulp into the sieve to extract as much liquid as possible. Pour the strained juice into glasses and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
This recipe makes around 3/4 cups depending on the size.

At The Zest Life, we like to add some simple toppings to make our porridge even more tasty and nutritious!


&nbsp;

Serves 2

<strong>Porridge:</strong>
1 cup porridge oats
Plant-based or dairy milk - approx 2 cups but depends on how thick you like your porridge!
Cook gently for a few minutes in a non-stick pan until the porridge thickens.. serve immediately

<strong>Orchard Fruits Compote:</strong>

I like to make a big batch of this and freeze it in small tubs so I can grab and enjoy whenever I fancy some.. It works beautifully with porridge, ice cream or even in your morning smoothie.
Chop a selection of stoned fruits - apples, pears, plums, nectarines all work well. No need to peel unless you want to!
Add to a pan with a splash of water and a sprinkle of cinnamon
Simmer gently until the fruit starts to break down.
You can either keep your compote chunky or pop it in your blender if you prefer a smooth sauce.

<strong>Toasted nuts:</strong>

Chop a handful of nuts - pecans or hazelnuts work well - and toast them in a dry frying pan until they start to brown.
Serve on top of your porridge for a yummy crunch.. and a healthy portion of protein and good fats!
And enjoy!

Enjoy a hearty bowl of this delicious soup which is rich, creamy (without the cream), easy to make and bursting with colour and flavours!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>2 tbls olive oil</li>
 	<li>large butternut squash, peeled and cut into small chunks</li>
 	<li>a generous handful of frozen / 1 tin sweetcorn</li>
 	<li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
 	<li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
 	<li>2-3 tbls Thai red / yellow curry paste (check label if you need a vegan version as some will contain fish paste!)</li>
 	<li>1 tsp lemongrass paste</li>
 	<li>3-4 Thai lime leaves</li>
 	<li>small chunk of chopped ginger</li>
 	<li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes / cayenne pepper</li>
 	<li>3-4 cups vegetable stock</li>
 	<li>1 can coconut milk</li>
 	<li>a good squeeze of fresh lime juice / swirl of chilli oil to serve</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Lightly fry onion &amp; garlic for a couple of mins in the oil</li>
 	<li>Add ginger, curry paste, lemongrass pastes, stirring for a couple of minutes</li>
 	<li>Add your squash chunks, lime leaves, pepper flakes/cayenne and stock and bring to a gentle simmer (lid on)</li>
 	<li>Once squash is soft, add the sweetcorn and then transfer to a blender (or use a stick blender). Blitz until your soup is smooth and creamy</li>
 	<li>Pour in coconut milk, gently reheat and then add lime juice along with any extra seasoning to taste. Once your soup is blended you'll have a better idea of how intense the flavours are, so you can tweak it to your own taste before serving. I like to top the soup with some roast peppers but you could top with fresh coriander, toasted coconut flakes or just serve straight from the pan!</li>
</ol>
Hint: Pre-roast the butternut squash as it gives the soup a deeper flavour, but if you're pushed for time, it can go straight into the pan

Retreat chef Catherine of Wildings Vegan Kitchen has shared her healthy flapjacks that still use a touch of butter and a bit of syrup but most of the sweetness comes from the banana... it's practically guilt-free!



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<blockquote class="">
<div class="">
<div class="">To make 12 decent size bars:</div>
<ul>
 	<li>150g butter (we use Naturli plant based)</li>
 	<li>4 tablespoons syrup</li>
 	<li>225g oats</li>
 	<li>3 over-ripe mashed bananas (adds natural sweetness)</li>
 	<li>100g chopped apricots</li>
 	<li>100g mixed seeds</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Melt butter and syrup in a pan then stir in all the other ingredients. Feel free to use other combinations of nuts/seeds/dried fruits (or even dark chocolate chips if you're feeling indulgent!) We use apricots, cranberries and seeds in the ones pictured above.

Press into a lined baking tin and b<span class="">ake for about 20mins at 180 degrees. </span>

<span class="">Leave in pan to cool as they'll need to set a bit before slicing. </span>

With its fresh, garlicky smell <strong>wild garlic</strong> is likely found growing in abundance in shady woodland environments near you. With blood-purifying properties, it is also thought to lower cholesterol and blood pressure. Enjoy whipping up this simple yet delicious recipe shared by our fabulous retreat chef Catherine from Wildings Vegan Kitchen. We refer to <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/things-to-do/foraging/">The Woodland Trust</a> for information on how to identify &amp; sustainable source this edible plant.

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>200g wild garlic leaves</li>
 	<li>50g parmesan (vegan option - add 4 tbsp nutritional yeast instead of parmesan)</li>
 	<li>1 clove garlic</li>
 	<li>50g cashews, walnuts or pine nuts</li>
 	<li>100ml olive oil</li>
 	<li>Salt &amp; pepper (or you can spice it up with a few chilli flakes)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Using a food processor, blend all the above ingredients together and add more oil to taste.

<a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/thumbnail_20210403_202459_01-e1617997858713.jpeg"><img class="border alignleft wp-image-3360 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/thumbnail_20210403_202459_01-e1617997858713-255x300.jpeg" alt="" width="255" height="300" /></a> This pesto will keep in the fridge for a few days but it's great frozen into ice cube trays so you can just grab a portion any time to add a gorgeous Spring flavour to your soups, salads and pasta dishes.

As an avid open water swimmer for the past six years, I have yet to find anything that shifts you into an upbeat, energised frame of mind as much as a cold water swim does. There is never a time that I regret going in, even when I’ve broken ice to plunge or had to battle waves to dive in. 

Wild and open-water swimming has been steadily growing in popularity, I believe it is the connection to nature that is the appeal. We are so removed from nature in our modern day world as we spend more and more time in front of screens and indoors.

Wild swimming is a truly intimate experience with nature, helping us to feel more grounded and connected to what it is to be alive and human. It is total escapism, no one can reach you when you are out swimming at sea.

<img class="border alignright wp-image-3190 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wild-swimming-blog-1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" />

One of the physical benefits of wild swimming is that cold water stimulates the lymphatic system, helping to boost the immune system, perfect in the winter when you want to ward of colds and stay strong. It also stimulates endorphins, the hormones that give you a natural high, creating a positive effect on your well being. The colder you get the bigger the rush, so you basically feel fantastic... it's just a challenge getting in sometimes!

The freedom of swimming in open water is pure bliss, compared to swimming in a pool. There's no end of lane, no chlorine, no other swimmers around you, its far more relaxing. You might not be in the water for as long but you can certainly start to build up your time and endurance in the cold water the more wild swimming experiences you have.

If you are keen to start cold water swimming, I would say the first thing to do is to find a swim buddy to go with, so for safety reasons you have someone looking out for you. Then locate a swim location either sea or lake - <a href="https://www.wildswimming.co.uk/">wild swimming.co.uk</a> have a number of books out with fabulous locations across the UK. I prefer to swim with no equipment but a swimming wetsuit and a tow float might be something you want to purchase - <a href="https://zone3.com/">Zone3.com</a> are great providers of such items.

The Zest Life host a number of <a href="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/best-yoga-retreats-uk/five-day-retreat-yoga-wild-swim/">yoga and wild swimming retreats</a> throughout the year. Why not join us and be expertly guided on a swim trip experience you will not forget.]]></content:encoded>

I went to another inspiring talk with John Fleet up yesterday. The topic was detachment. I don’t know how we got onto it but he re told a story about  a beautiful butterfly and it went like this....

There was a man watching a delicate butterfly trying to emerge from its  chrysalis. It looked as if the butterfly was struggling so the man, being the kind person he was, tried to help the butterfly by cutting the chrysalis open. The butterfly did eventually emerge but with swollen wings filled with water. For the butterfly to emerge perfectly formed it needed the squeezing and the struggle as it left the tiny hole of the chrysalis to drain all the fluid from its wings. Without the squeezing the butterfly dies.

Sometimes in life when we are feeling the squeeze and the strain it’s a reminder for us that struggles and effort are needed for us to grow. It's almost as if the struggling squeezes all the negativity out of us ready for new, brighter opportunities. So the next time you are feeling the strain, stick with it and know that beautiful more peaceful times will soon emerge.]]></content:encoded>

<title>7 Daily Detox Tips You Need To Know</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Spring-Sensation-food.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="262" />

With the stress and strains of the modern world we can start feeling overwhelmed, our energy levels plummeting. However with daily attention we can keep our mind and body healthy, lifting our mood, feeling less tired and improving our immune system. Little daily shifts will create the bigger changes long term. Follow these simple detox tips and energise your day!

&nbsp;


<h2>1. Digital detox</h2>
150 the average number of times we check our phones

9 the average number of hours we spend looking at screens per day

Detoxing is not just about the food that we eat. We need to recognise the fact that our health is greatly effected by what we eat, drink and think. So often we have clouded thoughts, we get caught up in the digital world and we generally don't take the time to be away from our screens to be out in nature which is where I believe calm and clarity arise. So maybe today as part of your detoxing, take a digital detox, leave that phone at home when you head out for your walk, look around, enjoy the scenery for what it is, not for how many likes the photo will get when you post it to instagram.
<h3>What to do…</h3>
Unplug for at least an hour a day away from all digital devices.

&nbsp;
<h2>2. Eat some raw</h2>
Raw food is full of enzymes needed for the digestion of food. When we cook food these enzymes no longer work and the body has to then make the enzymes to do the digesting, all of this uses up the body’s energy reserves. Which is why after a huge roast dinner you feel pretty lethargic. So make sure you eat plenty of raw foods with every meal so that your digestion is easier, using less energy, leaving you feeling brighter and lighter.
<h3>What to do….</h3>
Add raw greens to your morning smoothie or make a juice.

&nbsp;
<h2>3. Start the day with lemon water</h2>
My grandmother was a doctor and always used to say you should start your day drinking a pint of water to flush out your kidneys. I quite agree, but I take it one step further, drinking warm water with a slice of lemon helps to support your liver function and therefore aiding your body in its detox processes. Go one step further still and add a slice of fresh ginger for great anti inflammatory effects on your joints.
<h3>What to do...</h3>
Buy a refillable water bottle and have it on your desk to keep track of how much water you drink in a day.

&nbsp;
<h2>4. Breathe deeply</h2>
One of the best and easiest ways to detox is by breathing. By focusing on the breath and taking deep conscious breaths we give the body chance to draw more oxygen into the body and expel all the stale air from the lungs. Take a deep breath now and see how good it feels. The oxygen helps your body absorb nutrients and vitamins and it also helps make white blood cells which speed up the cleansing process in the body.
<h3>What to do...</h3>
Inhale for count of 4, exhale for count of 8. Repeat 5 times. Try it now and see how much clearer headed you will feel.

&nbsp;
<h2>5. Get outside</h2>
We all know how good it feels to get outdoors. But why is being out in nature and fresh air so important to us? Being outside increases our vitamin D intake, which has many benefits including improved resistance against certain diseases and helps with boosting your bodies immunity. The natural sunlight also helps to sets your body’s internal clock that tells you when to eat and sleep. Just ten minutes a day outside will greatly improve your sense of wellbeing.

According to a 2009 study published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, the closer you live to nature, the healthier you're likely to be.
<h3>What to do...</h3>
Get a dog, they get you outside…everyday!

&nbsp;
<h2>6. Get good sleep</h2>
When your body is sleep deprived it goes into a state of stress. Body’s functions are put on high alert, which increases blood pressure and production of stress hormones. So make sure you get good quality sleep, staying away from digital devices the hour before you go to sleep will certainly help.
<h3>What to do...</h3>
Meditate for ten minutes before you hit the pillow.

&nbsp;
<h2>7. Clean, happy, home</h2>
Finally, detox is not just about flushing away the toxins in your body. Have you ever thought about the toxins in your home? Regular house hold cleaning products have been increasingly found to have negative effects on many systems in the body including, nervous, immune, reproductive and cardiovascular. So try switching to cleaning products with less chemicals and that are less harmful to you.
<h3>What to do…</h3>
Buy Method or Ecover cleaning products, they are amazing and non harmful to you and your family.

<p style="text-align: left;">Nothing beats a warming bowl of soup on a cold winter’s day! Here's a fabulously hearty Italian favourite adapted by our fabulous retreat chef Catherine from Wildings Vegan Kitchen who has lovingly shared it with our The Zest Life community to enjoy! </p>
&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

1 bunch Tuscan kale or swiss chard depending on availability (you could also use savoy cabbage)
3 large carrots, peeled and diced
2 cups canned whole peeled tomatoes
1 punnet of cherry tomatoes cut in quarters or halves depending on size
1 rib celery, diced
2 leeks (white parts only), sliced
2 cloves garlic, sliced
2 cups cooked cannellini beans, half pureed
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing
½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1 bunch of fresh coriander
Fine sea salt, to taste
1 to 2 cups (2-inch) cubes stale bread

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Place the olive oil, carrots, leeks, and garlic in a large pot over low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables and garlic are soft but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the celery, and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables have softened around 8 minutes. Now, add the kale or cabbage and cook – always stirring! – until all the vegetables are very soft, another 8 minutes should do it. Stir in the red pepper flakes to taste.

Add half of the tomatoes and their juice, squeezing the tomatoes between your fingers to break them up. Add 2 quarters of water and all of the beans. Season to taste with salt.

Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.

Let the soup rest off the heat for several minutes, and then ladle into warmed bowls.

A nice tip to finish the dish is to slow fry the remaining halved cherry tomatoes in lots of Olive oil, garlic, fresh chopped parsley and top each serving with this.

&nbsp;



<em>Buon Appetito! </em>

<title>BAM - the best Bamboo clothing</title>

<category><![CDATA[Clothing]]></category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have loved the brand <a href="https://bambooclothing.co.uk">BAM</a> for a very long time now. Having followed their journey which began over ten years ago in the garage of their founder David Gordon. We love their values of delivering high quality, comfortable clothing and all the while their production sees that everyone is treated fairly and responsibly. Basically I see them as a company that cares!

The natural product Bamboo is awesome for clothing. If you haven't tried it yet you are in for a treat.

It keeps you cool in summer and warm in winter.
It’s antibacterial so your clothes don’t smell even on the smelly days.
It offers great UV protection.
It’s kind to skin which makes it really nice for anyone with skin issues and irritations.
The bamboo plant is super quick to grow too so it doesn't need a tonne of pesticides or fertilisers, which equals a happy planet!
And most importantly it is so soft. It’s like cashmere that you can wear to train in!

<img class="size-medium wp-image-2136 alignleft" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-13-at-16.57.41-204x300.png" alt="" width="204" height="300" /><strong>What we are wearing:</strong>
Serenity Top in Magenta Marl
Bamboo Classic Vest in Indian Ink
Cropped leggings in Charcoal Marl
Yogi Pants in Fig (Pictured left)

<strong>What the boys are wearing:</strong>
Bamboo Luxe T shirt
Bamboo Athletic shorts Indian ink

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All of our staff were very kindly given a whole outfit by BAM. What we loved most was that all of the items could be worn both on and off the mat. On those days when you feel so busy and rushed and you might not practise because you haven’t got the right gear on or you haven’t got time to change, there will be no more excuses when you have BAM clothes. It’s on those busy days that you can wear BAM from start to end . You will look good, you will feel great, therefore you will be inclined to move, whether its walk, run, hike or get on the mat for yoga. You will be able to jump on the mat inbetween tidying the house and picking the kids up from school, even if its just five minutes, it can be done. I’d like to say BAM clothes make life easier! You might not be able to wear these lovely clothes if you have an office job, mind you their classic vests make for great layering under a smart top maybe. But for a busy mum these clothes are a god send. They they wash well, don’t need ironing, they can be worn straight from a crumbled heap in the corner of the room and still look great. I wear all of these items to teach in and for my own personal practise too. What I love most though, is after a long day, taking a hot bath, then slipping into the soft yogi pants, with their kind double waistband and putting on the gorgeously soft Wanderer top with its long length that covers everything up. It’s in that moment I feel like my clothes are giving me a very welcome hug!

BAM have kindly teamed up with us to offer you our Zest Life clients a discount of 15%. So go to <a href="https://bambooclothing.co.uk/?gclid=CLPQqo7x1tUCFUa3GwodrpgNRQ">bambooclothing.co.uk</a>, get buying and get your clothes hug today! <strong>DISCOUNT CODE - ZEST15</strong>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hearing about a new active wear yoga brand is so exciting. Receiving their beautifully packaged garments through the post is one thing, wearing them to teach and to carry out my own practise is another and to absolutely love them is the icing on the cake.

Jilla active are a British designed active wear company based in London. Olivia and Bridget head up the company and have been so kind to send us a selection of items that all look gorgeous and feel amazing.They use a lot of Bamboo in the garments making them so soft and so comfortable to wear. They also always use a really lovely soft and calming colour pallette, which comes across as very classy, grown up and sophisticated.

<strong>What’s different about them?</strong>

The first thing that comes to mind is the detail. You know how some items of clothing you buy you might think “ I wish they had put that there, or made this bigger of that smaller”. Well these experienced designers have thought of all of that for you and done it. I cannot fault any of the items that were sent.

Since being pregnant, having my son Freddie just over 10 months ago and not really training properly, certain body parts had begun to sag! I felt so untoned and my butt wasn’t what it used to be! I went to teach one evening, putting on my usual leggings and was disappointed with the reflection. I felt unsupported and all a bit wobbly to be honest. I then however put on a pair of Jilla active “Be a wild thing Capri” and everything got sucked and tucked in all the right places. I was so amazed and pleased with how they felt, they were supportive and uplifting with out being tight or restrictive which is so important when you want to be comfy and relaxed on the mat. They helped me to feel more confident in my looks and my body. I know confidence should come from within and it doesn’t matter what you look like but sometimes we need a little helping hand and these clothes certainly helped me.

A lovely healthy, guilt free alternative to a flapjack. Tastes a bit like a banana bread but has all the goodness of the oats you'd find in a flapjack. They make a great breakfast alternative and also a great snack for the mid afternoon energy slump. Wheat and dairy too.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

- Makes 16

2 mashed bananas - the riper the better as easier to mash and sweeter

2 cups oats

1 tbsp dessicated coconut

1 tbsp pumpkin seeds

1 tbsp raisins

1 tbsp chopped walnuts

1 tbsp ground flaxseed

6/7 apricots chopped

1 tbsp peanut butter

1 tbsp maple syrup - add 1 tbsp  more if you like them sweeter

200ml oat milk

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Heat oven to 140

Mash the bananas in a large bowl.

Add the oats and other dry ingredients to the bananas, stir and combine.

Add the peanut butter along with the maple syrup, give it a good mix now.

Finally, add the oat milk till you have a thick consistency.

Grease a small baking tray with coconut oil and transfer the mix to the baking tray. Press the mixture down very firmly with the back of your hand, or the bottom of a clean mug.

Cook for about 25 - 30 minutes till the edges have started to turn golden brown and the mixture is quite springy to the touch. Cook for few more minutes if you feel it needs longer.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-1872" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/15027395_1183969888359120_8877152492050546426_n-300x300.jpg" alt="15027395_1183969888359120_8877152492050546426_n" width="300" height="350" />Since travelling in India I have always loved chai tea. Whenever I drink it I am always transported back almost twenty years to my first visit there. I remember sitting on a platform in Bombay waiting for my first train across India and being sold cups of wonderfully sweet chai tea while I waited. It was always served in tiny terracotta pots, almost like a shot of tea really and only cost just a couple of rupee a cup, a far cry from the tea prices of Starbucks. Anyway, a very good friend of mine Kate has given me this recipe of her divine chai tea to share. It's a perfect spice blend to warm the hearts at this cold time of year. Make the dry ingredients up and leave to infuse for a few weeks before making the actual tea. Finding a lovely beautiful tea tin to store it in is a must!

<h2>ingredients</h2>

70g (half a regular sized packet 125g) Loose black tea- Assam is a good choice

2 x cinnamon sticks - crushed

30 x cardamon pods - crushed

15 x cloves - crushed

30 x black peppercorns - cracked

1 x star anise - broken up

1 x nutmeg - finely grated

fresh ginger

honey

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Serves 2

Use a pestle and mortar to crush up your spices, cinnamon, cardamon, cloves, black peppercorns and star anise. Work them individually, then add them to your loose black tea. Grate in your nutmeg using a fine grater. Store in a tin for a few weeks.

To make the drink itself....

Place 3 cups of water in a pan and bring to the boil.

Remove from the heat and add 2 tsp of your tea blend, 2 tsp of honey and finally add a slice of fresh ginger.

Place back on the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.

Add milk to taste, bring back up to simmering.

Serve in your finest mugs, whilst wearing warm woolly socks and sitting in front of a fire.

Having just been for a fabulously cold swim this morning, all I could think of was making a warming soup for lunch. This recipe is so quick and so simple and great served with garlic bread!



<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 4

1 tsp Coconut oil

1 Onion

3 Garlic cloves

1 Celery stick

500g Mixed mushrooms - wiped clean and chopped- chestnut, button, portobello, wild

Handful of Dried wild mushrooms

Handful of Fresh thyme

1 litre of Vegetable stock

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Place the dried mushrooms in a small bowl and add enough boiling water to cover them. Leave to one side.

2. Heat the oil in a large pan and add finely chopped onion, celery and garlic. Sweat till soft and golden.

3.  Add the chopped mushrooms, thyme leaves and leave to soften for about five minutes on a low heat.

4. Once softened add the stock, enough to cover the mushroom mix, the soaked dried mushrooms and their fluid. Bring to the boil then simmer for 15 minutes.

5. Once cooked remove from the heat and blend to smooth consistency. A hand blender is great in this instance. You can add more stock, milk (dairy or Non) or cream, till you get your desired consistency.

6.  Served with chunky bread, ciabatta or garlic bread is fabulous.

It is wonderfully sweet, so you only need to use a small amounted diluted with either cold or hot water. We add a few drops to morning smoothies or pour over ice cream for a simple dessert. It will last for months in sterilised bottles.

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Blackberries

Cold water

Granulated sugar

Cinnamon sticks

Cloves

Fresh ginger

Juice of one lemon

&nbsp;

<h2>equipment</h2>

Glass bottles

Small funnel

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

<img class="alignright" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_7690-649x1024.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="500" /><img class="alignright" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" alt="" width="50" height="500" />

Sterilise your glass bottles, either in a heated oven or hot wash in the dishwasher.

Put your blackberries in a large pan and add enough cold water to just cover. Bring to the boil and simmer until the fruit is soft.

Strain the liquid form the fruit, return the liquid back to the pan. For every 600ml of liquid add 450g of sugar (I used golden granulated but white granulated can be used), two cinnamon sticks, 10 cloves and and inch piece of peeled ginger. Simmer until the sugar has dissolved then boil hard for ten minutes.

Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Strain the liquid and pour carefully into your sterilised bottles using a jug and your funnel. Label and then enjoy as you wish.

We started created this recipe last year after learning more and more about foraging and eating from the wild. The leaves start to appear around mid March and the flowers a few weeks following. Make sure you are confident at identifying the plant, (mind you the smell is so strong you can't miss them), then once you've located a patch get harvesting and cooking.




<h2>ingredients</h2>

For a large jar, Serves 6

2 Handfuls of wild garlic leaves

200ml Extra virgin olive oil

50g Pine nuts or walnuts

2 Garlic cloves

50g Parmesan cheese, grated

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Blanch the wild garlic leaves in boiling water for about 10 seconds. Immediately refresh in cold water, drain and gently pat dry with kitchen paper.

Put the wild garlic, oil, nuts and garlic into a food processor and blitz until you create a puree.

Transfer to a bowl and add the parmesan and season with s and p.

Put in a sterilised jar till ready to use. It will freeze quite happily for use throughout the year.

We serve this stirred through wholemeal pasta along side a crunchy, leafy salad. Its one of our Friday night arrival meals, thats filling enough to leave you satisfied and excites the taste buds for the weekend ahead.

<ul>
	<li>A yogic Detox stimulates the body’s own powerful waste disposal mechanisms – throughout the digestive system but also the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, endocrine and lymphatic systems.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Yoga creates a deeper awareness of what the body actually needs thus influencing more mindful choices of not only cleaner foods but also a more balanced lifestyle and chosen environment.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Letting go of physical and emotional tension is as important a part of a Detoxing as clearing physical waste. Yoga recognises the importance of eliminating “dis-ease” to bring the body and mind back into balance and optimum health.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Kriyas(cleansing practices)  and breathing practices(Pranayama) stimulate deeper more effective respiration &amp; circulation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Asana (Postures) – a carefully sequenced flow of Asana will create deep stretching and/or compression to first “wring out” tissue releasing cellular waste products.  As the stretch is released muscles, nerves and organs are flushed and recharged with freshly oxygenated blood and nutrients, energising &amp; rejuvenating the body.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Asana also have the effect of releasing physical tensions that are the result of emotional stress thus helping us to re-pattern poor movement habits leading to less stress on the body, better posture and deeper breathing.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Use of Mudra and breathing practices work directly on calming the parasympathetic nervous system which in turn can help slow the heart rate, increase intestinal and glandular activity and help deal with the stresses and strains of life.)</li>

It needed to be bean based for the protein but also have a great flavour. I came across this recipe in a newspaper supplement and tweaked it to give it a bit more of a kick. I hope you like it. It's great served piled high in the middle of large plate surrounded by warm pitta and fresh crudités, such as broccoli, pepper and celery.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

500g cooked butter beans

2 garlic cloves

juice and zest of 1 lemon

2 tbsp of olive oil

a good dash of tabasco

1 handful of chives chopped

1 small handful of dill chopped

1 tbsp small capers, rinsed and drained

1 tsp cumin

1 tsp dijon mustard

1 tsp wholegrain mustard

salt and black pepper

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Add all of the ingredients into your food processor and combine until you have a thick, smooth consistency.

Add salt and pepper at the end to taste.

The lower the sugar content the better, as some can be so sweet you feel your teeth are going to fall out when you bite into them. I experimented with this recipe taken from Deliciously Ellas' book. They work a treat and taste even better and become more moist after a few days. It uses a load of nut butter which can be quite costly but they are so worth it.


<h2>ingredients</h2>

360g small organic porridge oats

2 ripe bananas

6 tablespoons of maple syrup

6 tablespoons of nut butter - cashew/almond/peanut

4 tablespoons of coconut oil

1 tablespoon of raisins

1 dessert spoon of sesame seeds

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Preheat your oven to 200 celsius.

Mash your bananas in a small bowl with a fork.

In a saucepan add the maple syrup, nut butters and coconut oil. Then add the mashed bananas and simmer until a soft, gooey liquid  forms.

Pour the liquid into a large bowl and add the oats and raisins, stirring well until everything is fully coated.

Grease a small square baking tray with coconut oil. Pour the flapjack mixture into the tray and press it down very firmly. The mixture needs to be very compact. I often use the underside of a mug to do this. Then sprinkle the sesame seeds evenly over the top.

Bake for 15-20 minutes in the oven until the edges start to brown.

Leave to cool fully before you cut your flapjack up into squares.

It is great served with pitta and humous or we had it as a side with some pizza last weekend. Or why not simply enjoy a bowl of it on its own. It will fill you up but leave you feeling light and energised.

In a shallow frying pan dry roast the seeds and nuts for a few minutes till golden brown.

Then do the same thing with the raisins, helping to plump them up to bring out the flavour. Add them all to the salad.

Grate the ginger straight into the salad. Add the parsley and give it all another good stir.

Finally, coat the salad with your honey mustard dressing and enjoy.

My aunt came round with this cake the other day. She is allergic to many additives and preservatives so if she wants something sweet she makes it. This cake was beautiful. A real Autumn/Winter treat great either served plain or with cream. Perfect for using up the last of the Autumn apple glut. Guests on our retreat love it and I'm sure you'll love it too.

&nbsp;



<h2>ingredients</h2>

225g butter (room temperature)

225g caster sugar

3 eggs

225g gluten free self raising flour ( normal SR flour can also be used instead)

25g ground almonds

1 tsp baking powder

1 lemon zest and juice

1 large cooking apple peeled, cored and finely chopped

1 tsp demerara sugar

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Preheat oven to 180 and line a small rectangular baking tray.

With an electric whisk cream together the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl.

In a separate bowl whisk up your eggs, then slowly bit by bit pour them into your butter sugar mix. Stir to a smooth consistency.

Then fold in your ground almonds, sieved flour and baking powder.

Add lemon zest, juice and diced apple, stir some more.

Then pour out into your baking tray, the consistency might be quite thick by now but thats ok, then gently spread your mixture out and sprinkle with your demerara sugar.

Finally, bake in the oven for 35 minutes, check at 30 and it could be 5-10 minutes more. Your cake is cooked when springy to the touch and a skewer comes out clean when pierced into the middle.

Cut into large squares and serve with lovely cup of herbal tea.

This raw Red Cabbage and Apple Slaw is great for your digestion and energy levels. So why not take the time to create another perfect, delicious Autumn salad. This slaw is great served with a simple bean burger, or on its own with a lovely chunk of brown bread.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 4 as a side dish.



1/2 red cabbage finely shredded

2 medium sized organic apples grated

4 tbsp natural yoghurt

2 tsp mustard seeds

1 tsp cumin seeds

1 lemon zest

1 tbsp finely chopped mint

1 tbsp raisins

1 tbsp flaked almonds

Salt and pepper

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Place the cabbage and apple into a large mixing bowl, stirring in the natural yoghurt till everything is evenly coated.

2. Add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds, lemon zest and mint. Once again stir until everything is combined.

3. Next, in a small frying pan, gently dry fry your raisins for a few minutes, this will help to draw out the flavour making them even tastier and it plumps them up too. Once toasted add them to the mixing bowl.

5. Then in the same pan finally toast your flaked almonds, just for a few minutes being careful not to let them burn, so keep an eye on them and continuously stir them so they don't catch. Keep the almonds to one side until you are ready to serve.

4. Place the slaw in a lovely bowl, scatter with the almonds and some salt and pepper and you are ready to go.

He is often my go to  when searching for a particular recipe. I needed a gluten free, healthy, fruity muffin to serve after our yoga workshop. We were taking the time to share a light, brunch together and this recipe was perfect. It's quick, easy and they taste good too. I filled a basket full and they went down a  treat. If you are wandering where I get the brown paper cases from,  I buy them on line and I think they make them look even more divine. Have fun and whip some up fro family and friends. Finally, for an Autumnal variation you can substitute the Bluberry for Blackberries.



<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>200 g unsalted butter</li>
 	<li>50 g gluten-free plain flour</li>
 	<li>1 teaspoon xanthan gum</li>
 	<li>175 g ground almonds</li>
 	<li>190 g soft brown sugar</li>
 	<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
 	<li>6 large free-range eggs</li>
 	<li>50 g chocolate ( milk/white/dark)</li>
 	<li>150 g blueberries</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Firstly if you are not sure what Xanthum gum is, its a white powder and is a food thickening agent that is used a lot in gluten free recipes. You can buy it online or in most health food stores.

1. Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Line a 12-hole muffin tray with paper cases.

2. In a pan melt butter over a medium heat, then leave to cool slightly. Meanwhile, sieve the flour and xanthan gum into a bowl, keep the sieve high to add more air in and stir in the ground almonds and sugar. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract, then fold through.

3. In another bowl, separate the egg whites (keep the yolks for another day). Whisk the whites well for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they start to froth, this air will help your muffins be light and fluffy. Then, using a metal spoon, stir the egg whites into the flour mixture a little at a time – you want to keep it as light and airy as possible so make sure you don’t stir too much. Roughly chop the chocolate, then stir in along with the blueberries.

4. Divide the mixture between the paper cases. Place on the middle shelf of the hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden and an inserted skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool on a wire cooling rack, then serve. Great for breakfast on the go or as a treat any time of the day.

We crave sugar, warmth and comfort at this time of year, it's only natural to feel this way with it being a time of hibernation. So instead of reaching for the unfulfilling sugary treats make batches of wholesome healthy snacks, like these muffins, for the whole family to enjoy at any time of the day. The best thing about them is they are sugar free!</span></div>


<h2>ingredients</h2>

⅓ cup melted coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
½ cup runny honey
2 eggs
2 mashed ripe bananas
¼ cup milk of choice (I used oat milk)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon cinnamon, plus more for sprinkling on top
1¾ cups whole wheat flour
⅓ cup oats, plus more for sprinkling on top
⅓ cup flaked alomnds
1 teaspoon granulated sugar, for sprinkling on top

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Preheat oven t0 165 degrees Celsius. If necessary, line 10 cups of your muffin tin with parchment muffins cases.
In a large bowl, beat your oil of choice and honey together with a whisk. Add eggs and beat well. Mix in the mashed bananas and milk, followed by the baking soda, vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon.
Add the flour, oats  and flaked almonds to the bowl and mix until combined.
Divide the batter evenly between the 1o muffin cups, filling each cup about two-thirds full. Sprinkle the tops of the muffins with a small amount of oats followed by a light sprinkling of sugar. Bake muffins for 23 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.
Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack to cool. Enjoy plain or with butter or nut butter or both!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_7621.jpg"><img class="border alignleft wp-image-1384 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_7621-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a> Haws can be quite fiddly and time consuming to prepare which is why it makes perfect sense to use them in a recipe such as this where they can all be thrown into a pan with as little effort as possible. The outcome is a delicious ketchup that will wow your friends and family with. It will keep in an unopened jar for months. Then bring it out at Summer BBQ’s or as the perfect accompaniment to scrambled eggs on toast.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

<b>Makes Approx 6 x 500ml Jars</b>

1kg Haw berries from frozen
6ooml Water
600ml Malt vinegar
Salt and pepper
4 Cloves
2 Star Anise

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>


1. Prepare the haws by tipping out onto a large tray. This allows any unexpected creatures to make a quick get away. Systematically work your way through the haws removing any stalks and leaves. You don’t have to be too particular as the final product will be sieved removing any unwanted debris.

2. Boil the prepared haws, water and vinegar for 30 minutes in large earthenware pan if possible. (Le Cruset casserole dishes work well). A metal one reduces the vitamin C content and this is after all what you’re after.

3. Remove from the heat and push the contents through a large sieve. Discard the haws as there is not much else you can do with them.

4. Transfer the ketchup back to the pan adding a pinch of salt and pepper, the cloves and star anise and boil for a further 10 minutes.

5. Once boiled remove the pan from the heat. Removing the cloves and star anise before carefully decanting into dry sterilised jars or bottles.

<span style="color: #000000;">This time of year, as we shift from the brightness of Summer to the softness of Autumn (today marks the start of Autumn with the equinox) it is important to take the time to check in and start slowing down both in our yoga practise and life. The earths’ energy is closing in, and our energy does the same. So the fact that we feel less inclined to throw ourselves around on the mat for hours on end is perfectly normally. Follow these five simple yoga poses to ease and flow through this beautiful transition time of year.</span>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-1328 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11050836_864774603611985_7508347429254666425_n-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />

There is news everywhere on the internet about the government imposing sugar tax on sugary drinks. That’s all very well and good but will it really make the slightest of difference? I know that when I have had the worst cravings of my life in my Bulemic years it didn’t matter how much food cost I’d just buy it. The sugar was like a drug for me and we all know the lengths that addicts go to get their fix. They do anything to get those moments of bliss to escape the unhappiness of life.

For me I see that the problem runs far deeper than taxing sweet food. I believe to solve these obesity problems and get to the root cause, we have to look with in each and every individual. Why do we crave the sugar in the first place? We all know eating rubbish food makes us feel horrendous on all levels, so why do we continue to eat it? You can be told by your partner, your trainer your nutrition expert in your magazine what to eat but they are all external. You have to shift your thought patterns from within, so much so that your body starts to want different foods from the usual rubbish. We all know that sugar foods give us comfort so how about we start looking at our lives and see what comfort is lacking and making the changes there instead.

I’m currently reading a marvellous book called “The Yoga of Eating” by Charles Eisenstein and he has a whole chapter dedicated to this matter, entitled Sugars Sweetness. He talks about how we have lost the sweetness in our lives which is why we turn to the sweetness in foods. A profound extract from the chapter.

“Where is the sweetness for our soul to be found? Babies are sweet. Intimacy is sweet. Love is sweet. Your innermost self is sweet. The experience of coming back home, connecting with the divine is one of ineffable sweetnesss. Intimacy comes easily with babies, who are open and unthreatening, and with lovers when there is genuine trust, and with close family. With all these people we can know sweetness. But we are meant for more than that. Outside the narrow realm of family, we are closed off from one another, interacting on a very superficial level. How close do you feel to people you buys things from, your neighbours, you postman? Intimacy comes from openness and long association. Today we rarely have either. Intamacy hardly has chance to grow.”

I know I crave sugar when I am tired, stressed, emotional, premenstrual to name but a few. I have been known to head straight to the supermarket for cookies after class and when shopping for food on retreats the odd box of flapjacks gets thrown in there and they don’t even make it home. But on the whole, after years of battling, I have now learnt to be more in tune with my emotions which has helped dramatically with cravings for sweetness.

Tip 1. Take the time to acknowledge your feelings. When you feel that craving sit with it, or stand with it at the fridge, why not even pull up a chair at the fridge? Listen to what your body or heart is telling you, not your mind. Is it an emptiness, a lonliness, a longing, a tiredness, a need for love? Instead of reaching for the sugar, go and find the comfort and sweetness of life elsewhere. Love yourself enough to make a healthy decision rather than an unhealthy reaction to the situation. Honour the feeling, let the craving have a voice, listen to it but then choose a healthy response to that call.

Tip 2. Fill in these blanks at a time of need –

“I am craving sugar because………………….and that’s ok, but today instead of reaching for the………………I am choosing to …………………………….instead.”

Tip 3.  Mediate and slow the mind and body down. This will give you the time you need to check in with our emotions so that you can become more familiar with them and make informed decisions rather than rash reactions like reaching for the cookie jar.

Tip 4. Sit down and write down all the things in your life that cause you unhappiness, stress or pain. Be brutally honest with yourself and then see where you can make positive changes. They might be small to begin but they might lead to huge life decisions, like changing to a more worth while job or ending a negative relationship. Start small and bit by bit let your happy sweet life unfold.

Tip 5. Go to remedies for cravings…..big pint of water, healthy smoothie, camomile tea with a little honey stirred in, dates, dried fruit, grapefruit and orange cut up, long soak in a hot bath, ringing a loved one, writing to an old friend, taking a nap if I can, walking in nature, swimming in the sea……

We must rediscover the sweetness in our own lives, and only you can be held responsible for your life. There is no need to look to your weight watchers plan to tell you what to eat. Your body is such an intelligent being it knows what it needs to feel good. Simply sit with yourself, figure out where you are lacking sweetness in your life and make the necessary changes.  Life can be so sweet and it’s often the simplest of pleasures that are the sweetest.

<b>What to add into smoothies….Our top 5 super powders &amp; seeds</b>

<b>BAOBAB</b>

If you are looking for a powdered extract that is high in fibre, antioxidants and Vitamin C, the fruit from the African Baobab tree is it. It  also balances the release of sugars, which will help regulate you energy levels. Great for digestive health too.

<b>CHIA SEEDS</b>

Chia seeds, are favourite.  These tiny black seeds from a native South American plant have an amazing ability to provide sustainable energy, “chia” is the ancient Mayan word for “strength.” They are among the most nutritious foods on the planet. Loaded with fiber, protein, Omega-3 fatty acids and various micronutrients they are a must for your morning smoothie. 1 tsp should do the trick.



&nbsp;

<b>ACAI BERRY</b>

The Acai berry, found in the Amazon, is a super rich berry related to the blueberry. It is packed full of antioxidants and will help boost your immunity. Avoid adding to smoothies with greens in, such as spinach or kale, unless you want a grey smoothie that is!

<b>MACA POWDER</b>

It comes from a Peruvian root and has a wonderful impact on your hormones keeping them balanced. It’s great for fertility and reduces blood pressure. Best of all though is it has a sweet, malty flavour a bit like a Crunchie bar! Consumme up to about ½ tsp per day, too much can throw your hormones out of balance so its advisable to have a few days without to keep everything in check.

<b>SPIRULINA</b>

Simply stir into your juices and smoothies, for extra protein, Spirulina, a blue-green algae, is a complete protein containing all the essential amino acids needed for growth and muscle repair. It contains high levels of vitamin b12, calcium, magnesium and iron. Definatly a super powder in our eyes!]]></content:encoded>

They are such a quick, convenient way to get nutrients into the body to fuel you for the day ahead. I will generally make a smoothie post exercise, but will always try to have it within 30 minutes of exercise so as to replenish the bodies muscle and liver glycogen stores. This helps with metabolism, blood flow and enzyme activity.  It’s the perfect combination of carbohydrate from the banana and protein from the nuts, seeds and Spirulina. The protein powder also helps keep you feeling full for a good few hours. There will be no mind morning snack cravings with this breakfast.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Heres our 3 simple morning tips to keep you feeling healthy and vital....

How you start your day has a huge impact on how the rest of the day pans out. The first hour of the day is often referred to as the "golden hour", in that it is a special part of the day when you can set the intention, mood and vibe for the day ahead. Over the years I have figured out what works for me in keeping my mind calm and my body healthy. There is nothing better than starting the day off with a spring in your step, whether its ready for a day in the office or a fun day out with family and friends, we need energy and we need a positive attitude to get the most out of life. Here are my 3 simples trips to get you on the way to achieving that.



<strong><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10-benefits-of-drinking-lemon-water1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1258" alt="10-benefits-of-drinking-lemon-water1" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/10-benefits-of-drinking-lemon-water1-300x206.jpg" width="300" height="206" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-98" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="206" /></a>1. Drink warm water with lemon</strong>

Lemons are packed full of vitamin C. Warm lemon water serves as the perfect ‘good morning drink’, as it aids the digestive system and makes the process of eliminating the waste products from the body easier. I always remember my grandmother who was a doctor saying that you should always start the day with a pint of water to flush out our kidneys. This soothing drink is how I have started my day for as long as I can remember.

Here are few benefits to this daily practise.

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Having warm lemon juice early in the morning helps flush out toxins.</li>
	<li>It aids digestion and encourages production of bile.</li>
	<li>It helps reducing pain and inflammation in joints and knees and dissolves uric acid.</li>
	<li>It helps cure the common cold</li>
	<li>The potassium content in lemons help nourish brain and nerve cells</li>
	<li>It strengthens the liver by providing energy to the liver enzymes when they are too dilute</li>
	<li>It is of immense benefit to the skin and it prevents the formation of wrinkles and acne</li>
	<li>It helps replenish body salts after exercise.</li>
</ul>

As I sit here writing this article I have so much to be grateful for. I am in a new office that has just been refurbished and after months of chaos, dust and rubble I am so thankful of the calm clear space in which to work and create. I am looking out to a beautiful mountain, bathed in sunlight, a flowing river forging its way to the sea and I can feel the warmth of my dog at my feet. Taking the time each day to be grateful is one of the greatest ways to achieve a state of happiness and contentment.

Sometimes though we find it hard to find things to be grateful for, but when we take the time to really think about it, we have so much to be grateful for. Even a situation and experience that seems "bad, disturbing, harmful, stressful" will have a positive side. You just have to find it. Remembering that the gift is not the wrapping will help you see this. Even though something is presented to you in life and it may appear negative, always remember that the gift is not the wrapping and sometimes the greatest of experiences and gifts can be wrapped in fear, pain and loathing.

I often start by being grateful of the smallest of things that are closet to me in the present moment... breathing freely, heart beating, hands typing. I then slowly expand my focus of attention outwards, maybe focusing on the great, loving people in my life, my external environment, the community in which I live,  the beauty of nature, the mountains, the sea, the sky and beyond.....

Researchers are finding that individuals who exhibit and express the most gratitude are happier, healthier, and more energetic. Grateful people report fewer symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, nausea, even acne, and spend more time exercising! The more a person is inclined towards gratitude, the less lonely, stressed, anxious and depressed he or she will be.

So whats not to like about it? It takes moments and will greatly enhance your day. Journal your gratitude, tell a loved one, or simply quietly sit back and think of ten things your are grateful for. See them in your minds with as much feeling and awareness as possible. Be aware of the feelings that are brought up as you start this process. Hold onto those feelings of joy. I find its like an inner smile that starts to rise to the surface and it will be shining brightly all day if you allow it.

<strong><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/autumnrecharge-workshop.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-478" alt="Autumn Recharge Workshop" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/autumnrecharge-workshop.png" width="300" height="205" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-98" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="205" /></a>3. Exercise</strong>

I have been a fitness fanatic for as long as I can remember. There are so many things I adore about exercise...the endorphin rush, the feeling of being fit as to me fitness equals freedom, the awe of being out in nature, the connection with people when you exercise with friends or a group, to name but a few....It never fails to put a smile on my face and spring in my step.

Yes, there have been times when it has taken over my life and I had an unhealthy relationship with exercise but now as I find balance in my daily exercise routine it brings me strength and flexibility, calm and clarity. It always amuses me how the mind often tries to persuade us out of doing things that we know are actually good for us. So even on the days when I don't feel like exercise, its cold and windy outside, I know that if I simply put on my running gear and tell myself that I'll just jog for ten minutes then come back, I know that once I am out and running I will love it and want to stay out being invigorated by the elements.

Mix up your routine as well. Doing the same exercise everyday will soon lead to bordom. I run, swim, bike and do yoga and I love the results that this combination of exercise gives me. But everybody is different, so you need to figure out what works for you. I prefer to be outdoors where possible but for some the gym might be the answer. We all know exercise is good for us and with our sedentary lives, making the time to exercise is becoming even more important. Make the time for yourself, enjoy it, find something that you love to do with positive people to keep you encouraged. Even if its just ten minutes a day, you will soon start to reap the benefits.

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>NHS states that exercise can reduce your risk of major illnesses, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer by up to 50% and lower your risk of early death by up to 30%.</li>
	<li>Exercise helps use up oxygen, it causes your body to burn stored fat and helps you maintain a healthy weight.</li>
	<li>One of the most common mental benefits of exercise is stress relief.</li>
	<li>Exercise releases endorphins, which create feelings of happiness and euphoria. Working out for just 30 minutes a few times a week can instantly boost your overall mood.</li>
	<li>Improve your self-confidence as physical fitness can boost self esteem and improve positive image.</li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">Exercising in the wonderful outdoors can increase your self-esteem even more. Also the Vitamin D </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">acquired from soaking up the sun can lessen the likelihood of experiencing depression.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size: 1em;">It also helps with productivity. Research shows that workers who take time for exercise on a regular basis are more productive and have more energy than their more sedentary peers . </span></li>
</ul>
"You'll never get the butt you want by sitting on the butt you have". So go leap up, jump, skip, dance and feel free, fit and happy.

The cinnamon tops it off.  I have been eating it recently post my early morning run and swim when the body needs a tonne of nourishment to recharge.
<p class="clear">Low in fat, butternut squash delivers an ample dose of dietary fiber, making it an exceptionally heart-friendly choice. It provides significant amounts of potassium, important for bone health, and vitamin B6, essential for the proper functioning of both the nervous and immune systems. So with all this goodness what is not to love!</p>

This dessert is a feast for the eyes. I love the contrast in colour and the more fruit you add the more intense the rich purple colour becomes. It is a wonderful way to surprise people with a lovely dessert that is raw, vegan, dairy free, wheat free and the only sweetness is a little bit of honey. Everyone on our retreats asks for this recipe and I am certain your friends and family will de doing the same.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 10

<strong>Base</strong>

1/2 cup raw almonds

1/2 cup soft medjool dates

1/4 tsp sea salt

&nbsp;

<strong>Filling</strong>

3 cups cashews soaked in boiling water overnight

juice of 4 lemons

the seeds of 2 whole vanilla bean (or 2 tsp of vanilla extract)

2/3 cup raw coconut oil, melted

2/3 cup honey

1 cup blueberries


&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Blitz the almonds, medjool dates and salt in a food processor, until you have a breadcrumb consistency.

2. Scoop out the mixture and press firmly into a loose bottom 7" flan tin. Making sure you press right into the edges.

3. Warm the coconut oil and honey in a small saucepan on a low heat until liquid. Gently stir up to combine.

4. Back in your food processor, blend on a high setting the drained cashews, lemon juice, vanilla bean seeds, oil and honey mix until you end up with a smooth, velvet, cream consistency. This could take a few minutes so be patient!

5. Pour half of the filling over your nut base, spread with a spatula. Then add the blueberries to the remainder of the filling, blitz again.

6. Pour your now brilliant purple coloured filling over the first layer and put the whole thing in the  fridge.

7. Cut a slice and serve sprinkled with fresh blueberries or fruit of your choice. Pomegranates work a treat too. It will keep for 2/3 days in the fridge.

It turns couscous from a very plain, bland grain into a delight for the taste buds. I love cooking with pomegranate seeds, they are so magical, it's like working with little rubies and when you taste the salad, it transports you to some far away corner of Morocco. It is perfect served with a tagine and a huge green salad, or it can be eaten on its own as a light lunch. I know there are a load of ingredients in this recipe, so if you don't have all the nuts or all the herbs simply add what you can and it will still be delicious.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

<strong>Serves 4</strong>

couscous 250g

bouillion /vegetable stock

handful of mint/flat leaf parsley/coriander finely choppped

garlic cloves x 2 finely chopped

tbsp Toasted flaked almonds

tbsp Raisins

tbsp Pumpkin seeds

tbsp pine nuts

Zest of 1 lemon

Zest of 1 orange

seeds of 1 pomegranate

1 tsp ground cumin

1/2 tsp ground coriander

<strong>Dressing</strong>

Juice of 1 lemon

Juice of 1 orange

tbsp honey

4 tbsp olive oil

Freshly ground S and P

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Tip the couscous into a large bowl and cover with enough stock that the liquid line sits an inch above the couscous. Cover and leave to do its thing, approx 15 minutes.

2. If the almonds are not already toasted, dry roast them in a shallow frying pan, then place in large mixing bowl.

4. Plump up the raisins buy lightly toasting them in the almond pan, stiring them around until they fatten up, and you start to smell the sweetness. Add to the nuts.

5. Then add the herbs, garlic, pumpkin seeds, pine nuts, zest of orange and lemon, pomegranate seeds, ground cumin, ground  coriander, to the nuts and raisins.

6. For the dressing, in a jar add the lemon and  orange juice, olive oil, honey, mustard, shake up.

7. Once the couscous is cooked and all the liquid has been absorbed, lightly stir it up with a fork, getting right to the bottom of the bowl. Then add all the above ingredients and continue to stir it up as you pour over the dressing. Season well and then its good to go.

On purchasing a spiralizer i have been inspired to create a number of wholesome salads that quite simply make you go 'mmmmm'. One friend said 'this is one fit salad'. It's a winner. It's very light yet filling and it puts a smile on peoples faces when you tell them they are eating raw courgette not spaghetti. Fuel your body with goodness, feel light, fit and free with our favourite salad.



&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 4



200g quinoa

2 courgettes spiralized ( if you don't have a spiralizer yet, get one! But on failing that you can grate the courgette)

1 tin cannelini beans - could use chick peas or butter beans

2 handfuls of rocket roughly teared

2 large handfuls of spinach roughly teared

handful of basil &amp; flat leaf parsley finely chopped

1 perfectly ripe avacado

1/2 tbsp sesame seeds

S and P

<strong>Dressing</strong>

2 Tbsp Tahini

4 Tbsp Olive Oil

Juice of 1 lemon

2 x Preserved lemon slices ( if you don't have these don't worry)

<strong>Topping</strong>

1/2 packet feta

Tbsp pumpkin seeds

Tbsp raisins

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Cook quinoa, following packet instructions. Drain and set to one side.

2. Cut the courgettes in half and spiralize into a large bowl. If you leave them whole you will end up with metre lengths of vegetable!

3. To the courgettes add your rocket, spinach and herbs. Then add the rinsed and drained cannelini beans, avacado, sesame seeds and quinoa.

4. In a separate bowl (or i use sometimes use a jam jar) make the dressing. Finely chop the preserved lemons and add the tahini, olive oil and lemon juice, stir or shake well. Then pour over the salad. and get your hands in there and lightly stir up the salad, being carfeul not to squish it.

5. Serve out and then sprinkle a crumbling of feta, a few of the pumpkin seeds and raisins, finish by seasoning with a little freshly ground salt and black pepper. Sit back and enjoy your 'fit' salad.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is something so very comforting about a chilli, especially on late summer evenings when Autumn is on the horizon and we start to look for comfort where ever we can. I love all the extras that go with a chilli, the guacamole ( you can never have enough guacamole), the cheese, the natural yoghurt.... Every mouthful a differnt delight for the taste buds.



&nbsp;

This recipe can be made in advance and then easily heated up when you get back in from an invigorating swim or day on the mountain.This version we serve in late summer, with courgettes straight from the garden. In autumn though you can substitute the courgettes and red pepper for butternut squash and mushrooms. Both equally delicious and satisfying. It has been a very popular dish on our retreats, so here finally is the recipe for you to try at home.

(originally taken from Veg by Hugh Fernly Whittingsthall, then tweaked by me)
&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 4 - 5

2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil/rapeseed oil
3 onions, chopped
2 green chillies, to taste, deseeded and finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1/4 tsp allspice
2 courgettes, cut in 1cm dice
1 red pepper, cored, deseeded and cut into 1cm dice
2 tbsp tomato puree
400g tin plum tomatoes, roughly chopped and any stalky
ends and skin removed
400g tin of pinto beans, drained and rinsed
400g tin of red kidney beans
A good handful of parsley, finely chopped
A good handful of coriander, finely chopped
A handful of fresh oregano or tsp of dried
1tsp honey
1tsp mustard
1tsp marmite
bouillion vegetable stock - or regular stock cubes
sea salt and freshly ground pepper

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>


1. Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium-low heat, add the chopped onions and sweat, stirring from time to time until very soft and just starting to take some colour.


2. Add the chillies, garlic, cumin, cayenne and allspice and stir for a minute.


3. Add the courgettes and red pepper and stir to coat in the spices.


4. Add the tomato puree, tinned tomatoes with their juices, pinto beans, kidney beans,parsley, coriander, oregano, honey, mustard and marmite. Pour over 200ml of vegetable stock (enough to cover the veg) and add some salt and pepper. Simmer gently for 25-30 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the veg are all tender and everything is thick and saucy. If the veg starts to stick, add a little more water.


5. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding a little more salt and/or pepper if you think it needs it.


6.  Serve with guacamole, soured cream or natural yoghurt, grated cheese, brown rice and a huge green salad.

I was looking for a quick energising snack to sustain us when we came out of the water, tired and hungry. These were perfect. Neither sweet nor savoury. Ideal with a hot herbal tea.



Also pictured are lemon and honey flapjacks, sticky carrot bites - all wheat, dairy and sugar free.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Makes approx 12

125g almonds or brazils
125g almond butter
125g tahini
50g ground almonds
4 tbsp sesame seeds, plus extra to coat
1 tbsp spirulina powder
1 tbsp runny honey, add more if you prefer a sweeter taste

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Roughly chop the nuts, I have a little blender I whizz them up in, but its easily done by hand.
2. Combine all the ingredients in a bowl, until smooth. If the mixture is a bit wet you can add more ground almonds or more tahini if it feels a bit dry.
3. Take small handfuls of the mix and roll into balls, then roll each ball in the extra sesame seeds to coat.

4. Place on plate and refrigerate for an hour. The balls will keep covered in the fridge for several weeks.

We made them for our latest retreat "Yoga Rocks" where we hiked up Snowdon. It was these cookies that gave us the energy to get up to the summit.



They are dairy, gluten, wheat and sugar free so they are suitable for everyone with their funny dietry requirements.

They are also so simple to make too, so off you go, have fun and enjoy baking.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

3 ripe bananas

2 cups oats

1/4 cup peanut butter

1/4 cup cocoa powder

1/3 cup unsweetened apple sauce (or 1 grated apple)

1 tsp vanilla extract

Makes about 30 cookies
&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Preheat the oven to 350 F or 180 C

Mash bananas and add the remainder of the ingredients, stir and let sit for 20 minutes.

Drop a teaspoon of mixture onto a baking tray and press down with a fork to a flat cookie shape.

Bake for 10-12 minutes. When cooked they should be quite springy and spongy to touch. They are not hard like regular cookies.

Leave to cool and then enjoy xx

Black beans are crammed with antioxidants and are a great source of fibre an protein, so its now wonder we love this dip so much. It makes a welcome change from humous too. Dip some slices of red pepper or brocolli florets for a well rounded snack. Or spread onto a wholegrain wrap and top with filling of your choice.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Makes 1 small bowl

2 tsp virgin olive oil

¼ onion diced

1 tomato diced

400g can of black beans, rinsed and drained

2 tsp fresh chopped coriander (1tsp of ground coriander if fresh unavailable)

1tsp ground cumin

pinch of salt

pinch of fresh ground black pepper

½ tsp chilli powder or flakes (opt)

freshly squeezed juice of 1 small lime

2 spring onions, chopped

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Heat 1 tsp oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Sauté the onion and the tomato until soft and the onions have browned. Set aside and leave to cool.</li>
	<li>Transfer the onion and tomato mix to a food processor and add the black beans, coriander, cumin, salt, pepper and chilli.  Pulse until you reach a  smooth  consistency adding the lime juice as you go.</li>
	<li>Then garnish with the remaining olive oil and chopped spring onions.</li>

We are always looking for healthy treats for when we head out in the hills, either walking or out on the bikes. The snacks need to be energizing, protein rich and also able to withstand being squashed in a ruck sack too. These slices are a winner for this. They also make for a delicious savoury breakfast brunch, or serve with a large green salad and crusty bread for a lunch to share with friends.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 8 or (4 if they are hungry boys on a bike ride!)


Coconut oil., butter or ghee for greasing

2-3 large couurgettes

1 tsp salt

250g tub ricotta cheese

75g grated parmesan

2 spring  onions

handful chopped flat leaf parsley

handful roughly chopped rocket leaves

Zest of 1 lemon

3 large egss, well beaten

(opt 4 leaves chopped wild garlic)

75g crumbled feta cheese

Handful pumpkin seeds

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 170 (Gas 3) and grease a 23cm cake tin or small baking tray.</li>
	<li>Grate the courgette and place in a colander or sturdy sieve, then sprinkle over the salt which helps to draw out excess moisture. Leave for 15minutes.</li>
	<li>Combine the ricotta, parmesan, springs onions, parsley, rocket, lemon zest, and wild garlic if using, in a large bowl. Using a fork to help break up the cheese, it should be a soft consistency.</li>
	<li>Squeeze out as much moisture as possible from the courgettes using your hands. Add this now along with the eggs to the cheese mixture.</li>
	<li>Pour into your tin and bake for 45minutes-1 hour. Check to see when the top starts to brown.</li>
	<li>At this point remove from the oven sprinkle with the feta cheese and pumpkin seeds. Return to the oven for a further 15minutes until the cheese has softened and melted.</li>
	<li>The slice is best when left to cool completely and then allowed to set. So serving at room temperature is a good option.</li>
</ol>

The vibrant growth of young nettles is hard to ignore, and it really is about making the most of these spring greens whilst they are abundant. Because as far as I know Tescos do not sell nettles! So harvest away as much as possible and enjoy the cleansing effects of this spring soup. When there is a chill in the air it makes for perfect spring lunch. Coming in from the garden and tucking into this soup with a hunk of soda bread is heaven.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

Serves 8


2 tbsp olive oil

1 small onion diced

2 large leeks, trimmed and sliced

3 large potatoes, peeled and diced

1 ½ litres vegetable stock, Bouillion

Colander of sweet young nettle leaves.

5 leaves wild garlic

Salt and pepper

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<ol>
	<li>First things first get outside and gather your nettles. Use rubber gloves so as not to be stung. There should be plenty of wild garlic too so pick a few of those leaves whilst you are at it.</li>
	<li>Heat the oil over a medium heat. Saute the onions for a 5 minutes until they soften and start to become translucent.</li>
	<li>Add the leeks and allow them to soften with the lid on for a further 5 minutes. Stirring occaisionally so the leeks do not catch on the bottom of the pan.</li>
	<li>Add the potatoes and again sweat for a further 5 minutes with the lid on.</li>
	<li>Cover the contents of the pan with the stock, bring to the boil and then simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are tender.</li>
	<li>Finally stir in the nettle leaves and cook for just a few minutes until the nettles begin to soften and wilt.</li>
	<li>Allow the soup to cool and add the wild garlic leaves before liquidising.</li>
	<li>Season and reheat if necessary before serving.</li>
</ol>

	<li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Combine all ingredients together in a bowl. Stir together until everything is thoroughly combined.</li>
	<li>Roll dough into balls and refrigerate for one hour. (You can eat them right away, but I refrigerated them overnight so they maintained their shape a little better.) Makes 12- 14 balls.</li>
	<li>Another option is to stir through a desert spoon of Spirulina, it makes them go green, but its still the same great taste.</li>
</ol>

We started created this recipe last year after learning more and more about foraging and eating from the wild. The leaves start to appear around mid March and the flowers a few weeks following. Make sure you are confident at identifying the plant, (mind you the smell is so strong you can't miss them), then once you've located a patch get harvesting and cooking.



&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

2 Handfuls of wild garlic leaves

200ml Extra virgin olive oil

50g Pine nuts or walnuts

2 Garlic cloves

50g Parmesan cheese, grated

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

For a large jar, Serves 6

Blanch the wild garlic leaves in boiling water for about 10 seconds. Immediately refresh in cold water, drain and gently pat dry with kitchen paper.

Put the wild garlic, oil, nuts and garlic into a food processor and blitz until you create a puree.

Transfer to a bowl and add the parmesan and season with s and p.

Put in a sterilised jar till ready to use. It will freeze quite happily for use throughout the year.

We serve this stirred through wholemeal pasta along side a crunchy, leafy salad. Its one of our Friday night arrival meals, thats filling enough to leave you satisfied and excites the taste buds for the weekend ahead.

<title>Open Hearted through Yoganosis</title>

Why bring yoga and hypnotherapy together?

Well, firstly they are the greatest tools that I have in my kit bag for life. They have seen me through the many trials and tribulations that life has thrown at me. They have been with me for over ten years now and I can safely say that I don’t think I would be here today with out them. I had my first hypnotherapy aged 21 at my peak of “shitness”. Post aneroxia and in the depths of bulimia and depression. Unable to get out of bed, let alone be social, hold down a job, or do any of the crazy things 21 year olds are supposed to do.

Putting yoga and hypnotherpay together,  I know what physical yoga postures we need to do to get to an openhearted, free place, but it got me thinking as to what it truly means to feel open hearted on an emotional level.

The first words that came to mind were…open, confident, fearless and trusting. From those places we get to experience the love, joy and peace of an open heart. The image that came to mind was of my four year old nephew. He is open hearted, right there in his blondle bubbly being. He is so bright and trusting, into everything, exploring, the world, so inquisitve, completely fearless. I see children like him on the ski slopes shooting past me, completely fearless, whilst I faff about at the top of the slope looking for an easier way down, one that’s less steep and less scary. I love watching children when they are learning to walk, they are coming from and open hearted place. Arms spalyed wide, heart leading them as they stumble forward, but the green light is on and they are off. They stumble and fall but they pick themselves up again, the try things then fail, but then they try again and they succeed. Its in that process that the growth happens. Ages is 3-7 is when you grow the most on a developmental level in your entire life. I want to be like that four year old, constantly pushing my boundaries and growing and evolving as a human being here on this planet.

So what is it that we have as children that enables us to be so fearless and free that we then lose as we get older, grumpier and more closed? In my eyes its life situations that close us down. But thats where we have a choice as to whether we let them shut us down or whether we use them to open us up even further. Remembering that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and that nothing is sent that we are not formed by nature to bare.

To grasp this concept of being open and closed on both physical and emotional level, try something for me. Take a moment now to imagine how you might hold your body if you were about to be physically beaten up. Not such a great image I know but bare with me. You'd probably be hunched over, closed in the front of your body, protecting your vital organs and having the strongest part of your body , your back, exposed to the the threat. This is a natural instint to close up. Its easy to see on a physical level and just as we close up on in our bodies when we are threatened we do the exact same thing on an emotional level.

Your heart over the years gets beaten.  Life can be tough. Whether its loss of  a loved one, a betrayal, a death, a boss that constrantly tells you how you are not good enough, or you telling yourself that you are not good enough, the list is endless of the negative ways that our hearts can be treated. Either way its like taking a big baseball bat and repeatedly bashing your heart. Of course its going to close up. No growth comes from that place, why would we, we are fearful and untrusting and its safer to stay closed. But that place is like being stuck in a rut and a rut is a grave with the end knocked out.

On that emotional level then, what has helped me is changing the self talk I give myself and surrounding my self with positive people. My self talk has been and can be brutal, but everyday I try to keep it chirpy positive and happy. Repeating postive affirmations…I am happy and healthy, I am loved, I am powerful. Nothing fancy but I tell you the stuff works. It’s a little bit like wanting a withered, dried out plant to grow and blossom. What do we do? We nourish it with a little bit of sunlight and a sprinkling of water. You can think of the positivity being the sunlight and a good dose of healing hypnotherapy the water. Perfect combination for heart healing.

Then on the physical level, I think that’s where yoga really comes into its own. I have this idea that yoga fluffs us up. Those times when we are feeling dank, heavy, lethargic and uninspired yoga comes along and ruffles our feathers, it helps us to feel free, open and confident in our bodies and minds. It puts a spring in our step and that is a truly sweet place to living from.

From my own personal experience, which is the only place I can speak from, the times when I have been completely closed on all levels unable to engage with anything or anyone, yoga has been my saviour. What does it do for me? First and foremost it gives me strength. It gives me a physically ft and strong body. It's almost as if my heart is supported by this strong body that surrounds it. The heart then knows it can relax as its being held by my body beneath it. So even when my heart gets challenge and wobbles off centre it knows its got support beneath it which helps bring it back on course. Secondly, the practise then gives my confidence. Like the young child trying new things, failing at first but then succeeded, you try new postures which at first seem challenging and then after practise, sweat and persistence, things come. With those achievements come confidence. You then ask yourself “ I couldn’t do that before and now I can, what else is possible”. The comfort zone begins to expand and that’s where the magic happens. When was the last time you did something for the first time and pushed yourself out of your comfort zone?

The confidence on the mat can then be taken off the mat into the wider world. With that we start to develop this sense of trust. Because we know that whatever life and universe throws at us we’ll be able to handle it. I find myself saying “Bring it on!”.

Join me and be like that child running around, green light on, heart free, exploring, trying, failing and achieving, living, and really knowing what it is to be human… open, confident, fearless and trusting.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Food-hen-weekend1.jpg"><img class="border alignleft wp-image-310 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Food-hen-weekend1-300x200.jpg" alt="Food hen weekend" width="300" height="200" /></a>This is my favourite dessert in the world. It is so refreshing and cool and compliments any main meal. It is a real palate cleanser but hits the sweet spot too. I first experienced this pie whilst out in Bali last year on a yoga teacher training programme. Throughout the training we had fabulous raw food, keeping us fit and healthy. There was so much interest in the food that they decided to host a raw food cooking day, to share the knowledge. It was led by a wonderful local lady who had her own raw food cafe in the cultural town of Ubud. I have two recipes for this pie, one for when you are in Bali and you have fresh ingredients and coconuts available and one for back in the UK when we have to settle for supermarket supplies. Either way its all raw and amazing.  There is no wheat, dairy, gluten or eggs in this. This recipe shows us that just because we are choosing to eat healthily doesn't mean we have to sacrifice taste and flavour. Can't wait to share with you, here goes.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

<strong>You'll need a lose bottom metal flan/tart dish. Serves 12.</strong>

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Crust</span>

1 cup Macadameia nuts

1 cup Pecans

1 cup Pumpkin seeds

1/4 cup Chopped dates

1/2 tsp Vanilla extract

pinch salt

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Filling</span>

3 Limes

2 Avacados - Ripe and ready to eat

3 tbsp Coconut milk (mostly the butter with a little of the water)

2 tbsp Thick honey or agave nectar or 1 tbsp of each

3 tbsp Coconut butter (available at health food stores like Holland and Barrat)

1/2 tsp Vanilla extract

Pinch Salt

2 sheets of Gelatin (Vege version is Vege gel)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garnish</span>

Dark chocolate

Handful of Pistachio nuts

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

1. Blitz and finely chop the crust ingredients in a blender that has an S blade (or finely chop by hand). Tip nut mix into your dish enough to cover and give a good thick base (any leftovers can be used as a breakfast sprinkle). Spread out the mix and using the back of your hand press the ingredients down firmly, then leave to set in the fridge for 20 minutes.

2. Place your gelatin sheets in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes.

3. Juice the limes and gently warm the juice in a pan on a low heat.

4. Clean your blender the add, avacados, coconut milk, honey, coconut butter, vanilla, salt and blend to a smooth consistency.

5. Once the juice is warm and  the gelatin has been soaked, place the softened gelatin sheets in the warm lime juice till it has dissolved. Transfer this juice mix to your blender and give it all another final blitz. It wants to be a smooth pouring consistency, like a thick smoothie.

6. Pour the avacado mix over the set base, cover with cling film and return to fridge over night or for a few hours till set.

7. Once set its time to garnish. I love to make this dessert look as beautiful as possible to compliment the delicate flavours. Concentric circles, alternating between grated dark chocolate and chopped pistachio nuts work well. If I have plenty of time I sometimes use crystalised  rose petals around the edge or peacn halves work well. Either way make it look beautiful and then serve chilled, share and enjoy.

<title>Babaganoush</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="border alignleft wp-image-814 size-medium" src="https://keepmesnug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1662646_579007805522001_93294620_n-225x300.jpg" alt=" " width="225" height="300" />


I first experienced Babaganoush, this smokey Aubergine dip whilst on a yoga holiday to Dahab in Egypt many years ago. We had packed up a land rover and headed out into the desert for a couple of days with  local Bedouin guides. We slept under the stars and practised yoga at sunset, it was truly magical. Every meal I was amazed at the array of local wholesome food our guides created over a simple camp fire.  Babaganoush was one of them and ever since then I have been a fan. Humous will always be the winner but Babaganoush comes in a close second! Making this dip is a bite like making Humous, in the fact that it can go so wrong, when the proportions of Tahini are not right. But this is a great recipe, it's so simple and very delicious. Enjoy.



<h2>ingredients</h2>

3 aubergines
3 garlic cloves, crushed with a teaspoon of salt
1 lemon, juice only
2 tbsp tahini
3 tbsp olive oil
black pepper, to taste
1 Pomegranate

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Prick the aubergines with a fork, place on a baking tray and place in oven until the skin is charred and blacked and the flesh feels soft when you press it (this will take approximately 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through cooking).
In a blender that has an S blade (or you can use hand held blender or pestle and mortar) crush the garlic with the lemon juice, tahini, olive oil and pepper.
When cool enough to handle, simple peel the skin off the Aubergine. Mix the soft flesh with the remaining ingredients in the blender and give it all another blitz. You might have to do it in small batches
Place in a serving dish and finish with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of Pomegranate seeds over the top.
Serve with warm flat breads and a large green salad for a light lunch. Followed by some fresh mint tea for a true Middle Eastern experience.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Laura’s Learnings </b>

<b>Things I have learnt this year navigating my way through the fields of life.</b>

<b><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1479214_10151766794946436_238476893_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-786 alignleft" alt="1479214_10151766794946436_238476893_n" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1479214_10151766794946436_238476893_n-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="300" /></a></b>1.  <b>Too much of a good thing is wonderful.</b>  So much of the time we are thinking. We think too much, we judge, analyze, dither and ponder. Yoga teaches us to get out of our thinking heads and encourages us to get into our feeling hearts.  Often we don’t pursue life experiences and relationships, even though they are great, for fear of what might happen, pain and failure. It’s the negative chitta chatta that prevents us from really grabbing life and living fully. But my experience is, if we simply get out of our crazy thinking heads and get into our bodies, we stand a much better chance of flowing with the greatness of life. When things feel good, we are then able to run with them. Stop dithering and analyzing and simply go with all the good things that come your way.



2. <b>Turn up and get wet.</b> I read a wonderful book called <i>Darling Greatly by Brene Brown</i>. One particular part she talks about her daughter not wanting to take part in a swimming event because she fears that she will be rubbish and come last. The advice she gives to her daughter is “Just turn up and get wet”.  How often do you not turn up for life and stay sat on the side lines of the pool?  Sitting there where it is safe and also where you never get to experience the many joys of life. Well my advice to you is when ever you feel those feelings of apprehension, doubt and fear, turn up, stand tall, get your goggles on, (and arm bands if necessary) then please dive on in and get wet. Trust that all will be well. I’ve been trying to act in this way this year and so far so good. Often situations are presented to us that make us want to run a mile, but those are the situations that we should perhaps turn to face and get involved with even more.

<b><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zoeypic.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-782 alignleft" alt="zoeypic" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/zoeypic-300x206.jpg" width="300" height="250" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="250" /></a></b>3.<b> </b><b>Magic happens out side of our comfort zone</b>. The comfort zone, that’s the place where everything feels safe, where we are not tested or stretched in any way. It maybe comfortable but it is also a very stale place.  Growth does not happen in the comfort zone and I believe that we are here on this planet to grow and evolve as much as possible. I had an experience where I had to teach in London at the yoga show to a whole group of people I had never met before, this was way out of my comfort zone of the safety of friendly faces of North Wales. All the fears crept in, “How will they take to my teaching?”, “ What if they get up and walk out?”. But I did it, I got on with it and yes I felt scared, apprehensive, nervous and anxious and would you believe it, I survived. You come out of experiences like this, where you have been challenged and pushed, so much stronger and more positive. I am always left thinking “What’s next? Bring it on!”

4.<b>    </b><b>Dancing is awesome.</b> Whilst on a trip to Bali I had the luxury of staying in a cliff top villa that over looked the Pacific ocean and its relentless rolling surf. I spent many an hour on the cliff top, plugging into the nature and the rythyms of the waves. I’d have my very own little silent disco up there too, listening to my ipod and the craziest of tunes, moving my body, dancing without a care in the world. It felt so very liberating, to be simply moving, feeling and being. Before too long friends joined in the celebration on the cliff top, us all dancing up there in the sunshine made for a very smiley time. So take the time out to be creative, move your body, let go and start to feel free. And remember the dancing doesn't have to be on a cliff top, it works just as well in your front room!

<b><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Unknown.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-783 alignright" alt="Unknown" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Unknown.jpeg" width="277" height="200" /></a><img class="size-full wp-image-98 alignright" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="200" /></b>5.<b> Trust</b>. I have a great inspiring friend who often talks about the need to trust in life. She says that in life you have to switch the need for control, to a feeling of trust. There is a lot of comfort that comes from control, having that tight iron fist grip on all of life. It’s safe right? It may feel safe but it can be so restrictive, there is no freedom there. Trust on the other hand is like this deep knowing that all will be well, whatever life throws at you you know that you will handle it. So this year I have been learning to trust rather than control. I trust that I am meant to lead an amazing life, I don’t have to force it and shape it and that if I can let go of all the preconceived ideas of what I think my life should look like, all the goodness starts to flood in.  A couple of years ago I started running Saturday morning yoga workshops. People hardly ever booked onto them, I would panic that no body would show up and that I’d be there all on my own with one or two people feeling very embarrassed. I would frantically be emailing trying to get the word out in the hope that I could entice people in, getting myself worked up into a frenzy. But each time a workshop came about people would just turn up. More often than not the workshops would be packed out. I learnt to trust that they would be a success. So now each time I try a new event or workshop that I fear might be a washout I trust that people will show up. For us long as I am following my passion and doing what sits right with me, then I believe it can’t help but to be a success.  Control less, trust more.

<strong><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_7109.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-182 alignleft" alt="IMG_7109" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_7109-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a><img class="size-full wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="200" /></strong>6.<strong> L</strong><b>earn to listen to your heart.</b> Your body has an amazing way of communicating with you to let you know when things feel good or when things feel bad. The trouble is we often choose to ignore the signs that are there to keep us on the right path. When you injure yourself physically  the pain is there as a warning sign for you to get help and get fixed. Emotionally it is no different. When we experience feelings of anxiety, depression or stress its our bodies way of communicating with us that things are not quite right here and its time to do something about it. More often than not though we choose not to listen and instead we numb out those feelings, with alcohol, shopping , food, smoking, sex, whatever, in the hope that we can drown out the pain. The trouble is though it doesn't disappear, if anything the signs get louder and we have to do more of the unhealthy habits to block out the noise. Try to simply stop and listen. It may be painful but please listen and see what changes you can make in your life for the better, so that you can lead a freer, happier life. . It might mean ending a relationship that doesn’t serve you anymore, or resigning from a job that is making you ill. I spent the best part of this year in a relationship that I knew wasn’t serving me. I continued to drown out all the signs that signalled me to walk away. I was very much ignoring my instinct, but hopefully now I have learnt that my instincts are working with me and not against me, all I need to do is, stop, breathe and listen. It's from this calm place that I know the truest decisions will be made . The word heart starts with hear, so take the time to listen.

7.<b>  </b><b>It might take a year, it might take a day, but what is meant to be will always find a way. </b> Sometimes we want things so desperatly to be different form how they are right now. We have an idea in our heads about where we want to be and what we want to achieve by a certain point in life. Often the more you force something, the more it is forced away. So believe that there is a greater force guiding and leading you and that everything comes to you at the perfect time.  It might not be on your time but trust that it's the time that is right for you.  Last year I had a business venture that I hoped would be up and running ready for the rush of January 2013, but for one reason or another it didn't happen. I was gutted and frustrated that everything was taking so long. But now it is happening, a year later than planned, but still its happening and everything is all falling into place quite naturally. So patience really is a virtue.

8. <b>“Fuck it, it doesn’t matter so much”.</b> After reading this great book the <em>Fuck it Therapy by John. C Parkin</em>. I have learnt to say this, “Fuck it, it doesn’t matter so much”. I can’t tell you how refreshing it makes life to say these words. It lightens everything. Try it. When the car brakes down, when you don’t get the job you wanted, when you are late for an appointment, when you get dumped, please repeat “Fuck it, it doesn’t matter so much” and watch the sun come out from behind the clouds.

This year has been filled with lots of laughter for me, thanks to new friends that I have made that have helped me to see a fun way to be. I seem to have gotten rid of people in my life that don’t encourage a happy way to be which in itself  has created space for new care free people to come in. In the past I have taken life far too seriously. Yes of course there have been times of fun but on the whole it would be contained fun ending at 10pm, so that I'd get a good sleep ready for yoga practise first thing in the morning. But boy does that start to get dull. Life needs to be light.  At a wedding I went to recently they had one of those photo booths where you got dressed up in silly headwear and glasses before having your photo taken. I couldn’t believe how much fun we had and how much we laughed and I wasn’t even drunk. It reminded me how of as children you found enjoyment in the most simplest of pleasures. It made me wander at what point in life do we start to lose that enjoyment of simple pleasures?  So I have since bought a pair of the large, oversized novelty glasses and whenever I put them on, I can’t help but smile, its wonderfully liberating to be silly and take life lightly. I have yet to wear them around the supermarket but sure as hell it would make for a fun day. Don’t be scared to say “no” to the people that don’t serve you any more in your life and don’t be afraid to make a fool of yourself either so that you may live a very smiley life. "When you stop doing things for fun you may as well be dead" Hemingway

10. <b>Keep challenging yourself. </b>I had the pleasure this year of spending quality time with some very experienced yogis who could make there bodies do amazing things.  Floating up into a handstand being one of them, the strength and grace with which they moved was awe inspiring. Since then I have been trying to master this posture. It is still very much a work in progress, it may well be years before I get there. But everyday and every practise I am challenging myself, in an attempt to master this pose. Not so that I can put crazy pictures up on facebook ( i still might do that  though) but to work on the idea of being able to attain the unobtainable. Challenges are good they make us stronger. You try something for the first time and you suck at it, two years down the line you are getting there, ten years down the line you've cracked it. When you experience this in your practise on the yoga mat it then makes it easier to transfer into life off the mat, asking yourself "What can I achieve if I really put my mind to it?", the answer I believe is anything.

11. <b>Have gratitude. </b>When life becomes challenging,  it is a reminder to get back to basics, the basics of love and gratitude. Remind yourself each day of what you are grateful for. For as long as you are grateful you can’t help but feel happiness. There is always something to be grateful for.  When I remind myself of how amazing it is to simply be able to look up a the blue sky above, I can’t help but smile and feel gratitude. Gratitude allows you the space to breath and see the light in everything. Oprah Winfrey puts it beautifully “Be thankful for what you have and you’ll end up having more; if you concentrate on what you don’t have you’ll never, ever have enough.”

I was once told that life was like surfing. Sometimes it can be very challenging paddling out, battling against the oncoming waves, struggling to get where you want to be. Then once you are out there much of the time it is spent simply hanging out at the back of the surf, chilling, enjoying, chatting with your friends, simply being, developing patience as you wait for that wave to come. Then the waves come and you are lucky enough to catch one, riding and soaring with exhilaration as you're powered by the greater force that is nature. Then like all good things, it comes to and end and you're being tumbled and bashed around by the same wave that once gave you so much pleasure. It doesn't end there, because we get back on the board and do the same thing over and over again. Why? because it feels good and life is no different. There will be times of great elation and then great sadness followed by very mundane periods, but its never all bad or never all good, it just is. The hardest part is trusting that its all moving just as nature intended. So when you're being tumbled around or you find yourself simply bobbing and waiting, get ready because sure as the sun sets, that awesome wave will be coming. Get ready to surf the beautiful experience we call life.

13. <b>“Security in life doesn’t come with things, it comes with how we handle things". </b>I love this. It is taken from <em>Susan Jeffers, Feel the fear and do it anyway.</em>  This sentence really struck a cord with me. I have been feeling the pressure this year to be someone and to achieve something amazing.  In our society we often take how much we accumulate as sign of our success in life and it is very hard not to get caught up with that way of thinking. We seem to think that the more we have in a material sense the richer our lives will be, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Life will always be throwing challenges for us on physical, emotional, and mental levels. I believe how we handle these challenges is a greater indicator of how successful we are in life and how well we are living. Having a big house and fancy cars is all well and good but not much use if you are unable to cope when you have to stand in the face of adversity. Learn to let go of the idea of the need to have so many things to make you feel secure and focus more on developing a strength of self, a resilience that allows you to bounce back when faced with life's hurdles.

14. <b>For everything you have missed, you gain something else.</b> Doors close on us all the time. It is very difficult not to keep looking back at that closed door wishing it would open. It’s a painful place to be, it’s a waste of energy, time and emotion looking back to the past. I have been learning to simply turn and look the other way. I had a massive door close on me this year, one I thought would stay open always but it really was a blessing, as an even bigger door opened, one that I didn’t even know existed. New opportunities and exciting experiences will be presented to us for as long as we can remain open and look forward to see them. Don’t regret that a door has closed, just stop, breathe and rejoice in the potential of a new door opening.

<b>Hope is wishing, trust is believing, faith is knowing. Now go, make 2014 awesome.</b>

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7891.jpg"><img class="border wp-image-742 alignleft" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7891-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_7891" width="300" height="250" /></a>This recipe has a little story... it was given to me by my friend's sister. Her family home was always a joy to visit. She had two young children and the kitchen was a constant hive of activity. Glueing and sticking craft sessions going on one minute, to baking cakes the next, before turning everything around to create lunches that seemed to appear out of nowhere. Breakfast was no different. An array of delights would be laid out, from yoghurts, to fruit, criossant and toasts. This granola in all its glory, full of apricots, coconut, nuts and seeds, was always present.

When making, eating or serving this granola I will always be reminded of those fond times spent with my friends family. It is so much more than just a recipe for me. I now serve it as part of breakfast on my retreat weekends where it it goes down a storm. I hope you enjoy it on lazy weekends with families, just as much as I did and continue to do.

<h2>ingredients</h2>

1/3 Cup Olive Oil

2 Cups Honey

1/3 Cup Soft Brown Sugar

4 Cups Porridge Oats

4 Cups Rice Krispies

2 Cups Pine Kernels

1 Cup Dired Apricots - chopped

2 Cups Raisins

1 Cup Dried Prunes - chopped

1 Cup Desicated Coconut

2 Cups Flaked Almonds

1 Cup Sesame Seeds

&nbsp;

2. Pour the liquid over the dry ingredients, stirring it all up and voila, delicious granola ready to go.

This recipe is from the Good Food website and the squares make a perfect afternoon snack or as a dessert served with cream. You can use this recipe in the summer by substituting the blackberries for strawberries, raspberries or blueberries.

&nbsp;

<h2>ingredients</h2>

250g self-raising flour

25g oats

280g soft brown sugar

200g cold butter, cut into pieces

75g dessicated coconut

2 medium eggs, beaten

350g fresh blackberries ( I sometimes use Elderberries added to the mix if I don't have enough b berries)

&nbsp;

<h2>method</h2>

Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

2. Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips until only small pea-size pieces remain.

Stir the oats, sugar and coconut through the flour butter mix , then fill a teacup with the mixture and set this aside.

4. Stir the eggs into the bowl of mixture, then spread over the bottom of a lined baking tin (31 x 17cm), or a 21cm square tin. Smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.

&nbsp;

Then scatter over the blackberries followed by the reserved teacup mixture and bake for 1 hr to 1 hr 15 minutes until golden and cooked through (if you poke a skewer in, it should come out with moist crumbs but no wet mixture).

Leave to cool, then remove from the tin and cut into squares. Serve with some extra berries, and natural yoghurt or simply plain makes a perfect tasty morsel.

They also make perfect gifts, or as an after dinner sweetness. What is great is that there is no junk in them, all the ingredients are so good for you and they are so simple to make. Over the years of making these chocolate balls, I have adapted the basic recipe, experimenting with different flavours to the basic mix. I like to keep the flavours seasonal and love adding a tablespoon of mince meat for a christmas twist.



&nbsp;

I serve these on my weekend retreats and they always go down a storm. Have fun, don't be scared to be inventive and enjoy creating, eating and sharing. xx

Once combined you can start adding your flavours. Add a handful of oats to begin. Then the zest of your orange, flaked almonds and the stem ginger chopped into small pieces.

3. Place the bowl and its contents in the fridge for 10-15 minutes or so, allowing the mixture to harden up a bit. In the mean time you have a little tidy up.

Sprinkle a load of desiccated coconut over a plate and have a clean plate ready for your chocolate balls. Make your  balls by taking a large teaspoon of the mixture, rolling it in the palm of your hands till a ball shape is created. Roll and cover them in the dessicated coconut.(other options are to roll in finely chopped nuts, cocoa or icing sugar). Best served chilled.

Store in airtight container in the fridge.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Zest-Philosophy-balance1.png"><img class=" wp-image-432 alignleft" alt="Zest-Philosophy-balance" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Zest-Philosophy-balance1-300x207.png" width="300" height="300" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="300" /></a>At this time of year, when I find myself all of a sudden in the depths of Autumn, I really begin to appreciating the immune boosting qualities that yoga has to offer. Yoga is a wonderful system that can keep us fit and healthy as we transition into the colder months.</p>
With the colder weather or nasal linings become thinner making us more susceptible to infection. Through our yoga practise we can boost our bodies immunity so that is able to cope with the onslaught of bacteria and viruses that come with this time of year. There are four systems in the body that yoga postures focus on keeping us fit and healthy.

&nbsp;



<strong>1. Circulation - Cardiovascular and Lymphatic systems</strong>

<strong>Cardiovascular</strong>

Your heart is the power house of your cardiovascular system. It keeps nutrient and oxygen rich blood flowing through blood vessels to the various body parts for proper functioning. Poor circulation on the other hand plays a role in almost every diseease. Therefore it is essential to keep the blood flow and the heart working efficiently if we are to stay fit and vital.

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-183.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-696 alignright" alt="yoga 183" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-183-300x133.jpg" width="300" height="160" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="wp-image-98 alignright" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="160" /></a>Sun salutations and dynamic flow sequences thatare aerobic stimulate the heart, strengthening it, helping to  increase the blood circulation throughout the body. Relaxation on the other hand is vital as it allows the arteries to open up and actually lowers blood pressure. Relaxation is an important skill when considering immunity.

&nbsp;

<strong>Lymphatic System</strong>

The lymphatic system works in conjunction with the cardiovascular system, transporting lymph around the body through vessels to lymph nodes where there are white blood cells ready to  help defend against infections. It keeps blood and lymphatic fluid levels in balance and helps to flush toxins out of the body. The difference though is that unlike the circulation system, the lymphatic system does not have a pump to encourage the flow of lymph around the body. It relies purely on gravity and muscle contraction.

If your lymphatic slows down and becomes stagnat which is what happens when we become very sedentary a toxic build up is created in the nodes, leaving us feeling sluggish and decrease our ability of fight off illness.

Focusing on twists stimulates the flow of lymph up through the core of your body. Inversions reverse the effects of gravity and help to drain lymph up from the legs. Aerobic flow works on contracting and relaxing the muscles which is the primary way in which lymph flows around the body.

<strong>2. Digestion</strong>

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-132.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-693 alignleft" alt="yoga 132" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-132-300x239.jpg" width="300" height="250" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="250" /></a>Your digestive system is a major immune organ in your body. If there are problems in your digestive system, there may be problems with your immune system. For example, a number of symptoms may be aggravated by digestive issues, such as skin rashes, seasonal allergies, arthritis, etc. When dealing with any immune issues, the digestive system is very important to consider. A sluggish digestive system causes toxins to move from the digestive tract into the nearby lymph, leading to an increased toxicity in the blood.

Yoga postures, especially twists help to detoxify and oxygenate this system so that is running more efficiently.

<strong>3. Respiration</strong>

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-169.jpg"><img class="wp-image-694 alignright" alt="yoga 169" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-169-300x278.jpg" width="300" height="290" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="wp-image-98 alignright" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="290" /></a>Colds are caused by bacteria that affect the upper respiratory system, causing stuffiness, coughing, and sore throat. If the immune system is weak, the bacteria can go into the lungs and cause bronchitis or pneumonia.

Yoga is one of the main tools for maintaining the health of our respiratory system. Breathing techniques and posture work help improve the efficiency of our lungs by conditioning the respiratory tract, which in turn increases the elasticity and strength of the whole lung. When the lungs are stronger we are better equipped at fighting infection.

<strong>4. Endocrine System</strong>

The Endocrine system is one of the most important parts of the body because overall, it regulates mood, controls growth/development, metabolism, tissue functions and also all of your sexual and reproductive systems. The endocrine system is one of the primary ways to regulate  the bodies immunity.

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-179.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-697 alignleft" alt="yoga 179" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yoga-179-300x194.jpg" width="300" height="194" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="200" /></a>Yoga helps to balance the hormones you need for strong immunity. Inversions create pressure on the thymus gland at the base of the throat stimulating the endocrine system, which works with the nervous and immune system for efficient functioning.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>Any postures that work on one or more of these systems will lead to an improved immunity.</strong>

<strong>Neck exercises</strong> - Stimulating the flow of lymph from your body to your head. One third of your lymph nodes are present in your neck therefore it is vital to keep these pathways open.

<strong>Sun salutations</strong> - Improve  blood circulation.

<strong>Cat and cow</strong> - Improved digestion.

<strong>Cobra</strong> - Chest opener, stimulating the thymus gland one of the major organs involved with immunity.

<strong>Bridge</strong> - Improved functioning of the lungs

<strong>Wide leg forward fold</strong> - Stimulates the lymph nodes in your groin.

<strong>Shoulder stand</strong> - Full body cleanse. Reversing the effects of gravity, allowing lymph to flow around the body to the nodes.

Try out these postures on as regular basis as possible. In my eyes it is all about prevention rather than cure, don't wait till its too late, keep nurturing and looking after your body and it will take care of everything else this Autumn.

We woke to sun streaming across the fields, trees glowing in the morning light, it was the perfect Autumn morning.  We started the course by exploring the hedgerows, fields and lanes on the Clwydian range. I have grown up roaming this area and it gave me great pleasure to share this beautiful part of the world with my guests. We tromped up the fields from the back of the farm, stopping to chat and discuss the various hedgerow shrubs and trees. We looked at their habitat, their leaf structures, discussed the traditional folklore tales behind the trees and and most importantly we harvested their fruit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7669.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-670 alignright" alt="IMG_7669" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7669-300x189.jpg" width="300" height="189" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-98 alignright" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="200" /></a>Basket loads of fruit infact, to take home to the country kitchen. Rosehip, Rowan, Blackberry, Hawthorn and Elderberry were the main focus. We nibbled on various plants along the way, including chickweed which makes for a fabulous addition to salads. After a wonderful alfresco lunch back at the farm, it was into the kitchen to turn our harvest into culinary delights. My favourite being the Elderberry Flu Remedy.</p>


&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elder ~ Sambucus Nigra</span></b></p>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Harvest Time ~ August - September</span></b>

The Elder is a medium sized deciduous tree or shrub that blossoms from May with its delicate spray of tiny white flowers followed by the blackish purple berries from late August. This weekend we will be purely looking at the Elderberry but there are also a number of recipes when using the Elderflower in June.

The elder is used in the liquer Sambuca so called because of the plants latin name. The berries have a high Vitamin C content and are highly effective at treating colds and flu. The Anglo saxon name for the elder was ‘aeld’ meaning fire. This name derived from the fact that the branches when hollowed out would be used as bellows to blow air  through to help start fires.

NOTE : When harvesting the elderberries use secateurs to snip just above the head of the spray of berries. If you have time, transfer the berries to the freezer for a few hours. This hardens up the berries and will make life much easier and far less messy when it comes to removing the berries from the stalks using a fork.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Elderberry Flu Remedy (Elderberry Ribena!)</span></b>

The elderberry contains a substance known as Sambucol, from the latin name of the plant Sambucus Nigra. This substance has proved highly effective in curing colds and flu. Many pharmaceutical companies are now looking into the elderberry as an effective antidote to colds and flu. Don’t be surprised to see more elderberry based remedies on the market before too long. But here we can make our own remedy that is not only has amazing healing properties for the immune system but tastes delicious too.

<b>Makes approx 2 Litres</b>

<b>Ingredients</b>

2 kg Elderberries
Granulated Sugar
Lemons
Cloves
Cinnamon stick
Orange

<b>Method</b>

1. Pick your elderberries and prepare by stripping them from their stalks using a fork, into a large bowl. (See freezer tip above)

2. Put in a large pan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and simmer till soft. Roughly 30 minutes.

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7698.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-678 alignleft" alt="IMG_7698" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7698-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-98 alignleft" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="200" /></a>3. Strain the liquid pulp through a sieve and measure the liquid that you have aquired. For every 600ml of elderberry juice add the juice of 1 lemon, 10 cloves and 450g sugar.

4. Return to the heat and add a 2cm piece of ginger, cinnamon stick and the peel of an orange. Simmer till the sugar has dissolved then boil hard for ten minutes.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7690.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-679 alignright" alt="IMG_7690" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_7690-190x300.jpg" width="190" height="300" /></a><a href="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg"><img class="wp-image-98 alignright" alt="Zestlife" src="http://thezestlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/puple-line-e1377010549756.jpg" width="50" height="300" /></a>5. Remove from the heat and let the liquid cool before removing the ginger, cloves, cinnamon and peel.

6. Decant into warm sterilised bottles where the remedy will keep for up to a year. This can also be stored in the freezer in bags or a versatile way is to pour the remedy into ice cube trays. That way you can simply add hot water to a couple of the ice cubes and you have yourself a perfect winter warmer drink, that not only tastes heavenly but will keep colds and flu at bay. Enjoy xx
